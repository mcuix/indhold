    <p>Greetings!</p>

<p>Once more a quick update on how things are going and to keep you knowing what I have been up to.</p>

<p>First and foremost, I am working on a rather massive comparison on how some 140 ninja speak from across all manner of media, mostly comics, cartoons, games, films and literature, but the amount of work of that has put my schedule back a bit.</p>

<p>Second, I am working on translating articles and an interview relating to X-Men vs Street Fighter and a certain other un-released arcade fighting game that can be best described as Sengoku Basara meets Knights of the Round.</p>

<p>These will be published either this week or the following ones.</p>

<p>I have been a bit under the weather due to stress arising from current events.</p>

<p>As always stay safe.</p>

<p>ご辛抱をください</p>
