    <p>In Street Fighter 6, Gouki aka Akuma, performs his iconic finishing move, the Shungokusatsu (瞬獄殺, &quot;instant hell slaying&quot;, or alternatively, &quot;imprisoning death flash&quot;), whilst reciting the following poem:</p>

<p>一瞬千撃 抜山蓋世 鬼哭啾啾 故豪鬼成</p>

<p>Isshun sengeki, batsuzangaisei, kikokushuushuu, yue (ni) Gouki (ni) naru</p>

<p>On a surface level, a literal translation of this would be:</p>
<p>&quot;A thousand strikes in one instant. Piercing mountains and covering worlds. Oni&#x27;s restlessly wail and whimper, therefore, I become the mighty oni.&quot;</p>

<p>But there more to this, two of the lines are idioms (抜山蓋世 鬼哭啾啾), whose figurative meanings renders the poem translation as:</p>

<p>&quot;A thousand strikes in an instant. Having herculean strength, the spine-chilling wailing of restless ghosts, for this reason, I am become the mighty oni&quot;</p>

<p>You can take it both ways, but the very last line is written in the format of Classical Chinese poetry:</p>

<p>故豪鬼成</p>

<p>Yue (ni) Gouki (ni) naru</p>

<p>&quot;Therefore I become the mighty oni&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mighty oni&quot; itself being a literal translation of his own name Gouki.</p>

<p>These lines are in turn a reference to a moment in Masahiko Nakahira&#x27;s Street Fighter Zero manga series.</p>

<p>The move itself takes usually, in the games, the form of Gouki floating towards the enemy, grabbing them and in a flash they lay defeated at his feet, and he displays the kanji for &quot;heaven&quot;(天) on his back.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>This has also been covered quite thoroughly on Eventhubs, though there are a few errors such as translating Gouki&#x27;s name as &quot;proud demon&quot; rather than &quot;mighty oni&quot;.</p>
