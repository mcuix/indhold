    <p>So, I have not published any articles on this blog for a while, and for the sake of giving news in regards to where things are heading.</p>

<p>I am working on research for several projects, and one blog post regarding SNK&#x27;s bizarre localisation/translation of Samurai Shodown into English is in the works, as is a general introduction to more complex keigo with specific examples from fiction.</p>

<p>The bigger translation comparison projects are currently paused due to personal reasons, mainly a bit of stress of having to go through the vast amounts of material.</p>

<p>That being said, I will return to them, especially the fairy-tale ones. A Christmas Carol is another one that I have had my sights on resuming since it was left unfinished, so it may or may not be released within either the winter months (October, November and December) or specifically in the weeks leading up towards Christmas.</p>

<p>As always thanks for your continued patience and readership.</p>

<p>貴覧とご辛抱を心よりありがとうございます、皆様方。</p>
