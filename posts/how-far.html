    <p>How far is enough for science fiction.</p>

<p>The Dune franchise takes place in the late 25th millennium, Warhammer 42K – as it says – takes place even further, during the 42nd millennium. Do these numbers even matter, what gain are they to a consumer in terms of appreciating the narrative of the franchises. Would it make either of them less futuristic or great if they were set 10.000 years less? Not really. The solution is of course due to the intricate chronology within the series’ mythos.</p>

<p>Dune’s story makes reference to a far, almost forgotten, past where the origins of the series’ various events and characters occur. The appendices for the first books hinted at this, but the posthumous prequel series cemented it as a fact. Advanced robots brought about the near extinction of humanity, but they prevailed and their descendants became members of a vast network of empires and communities.</p>

<p>Warhammer’s own internal timeline has an even deeper prehistory apart from his future setting only rendering things even more unfathomable with the Emperor of Mankind being some manner of immortal from the depths of neolithic Europe.</p>

<p>In the following I will provide a short, but by no means total or exhaustive list of all fiction that is set in a distant future that results in a fantasy-esque setting – this will inevitably be spoiler filled.</p>
