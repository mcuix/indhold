    <p>Greetings!</p>

<p>Once more it is time for a semi-weekly update of sorts (though by the current standard of things it seems to hover between various definitions of exactly and hebdomadally that seven days ought to constitute a week and not 8 or 10.).</p>

<p>Work is being done on various projects - research-wise that is.</p>

<p>The current massive translation comparison projects, one of which namely is the Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes, will be worked on shortly, but I need a break from any massive writing as of now. Respite from constant stressful writing sessions usually also helps with having the mental stamina to handle other projects, too.</p>

<p>As mentioned, I will also be taking care of smaller blog posts - not just appertaining to linguistics, but as of now that is the main focus on this blog and the bulk of my interests.</p>

<p>Indeed, schedules may shift to something more propitious, but as of now taking it at a slower if easier pace helps me allocate the time spent on various projects more evenly.</p>
