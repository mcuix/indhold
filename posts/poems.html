    <p>Here is another poem which was originally written a few years ago, but has since become part of a poem collection that I am working on.</p>

<p>This was one was written in one go, I do not exactly recall the inspiration for it, but judging from the alliteration and seeming spoof on folk songs, it could be in the vein of fairy-tales, but ultimately with an absurdist angle, in the same spirit as The Scrummy Lummy, a fairy-tale that I wrote some time ago, which will in all likelihood also be uploaded to this blog.</p>

<p>Moon</p>
<p>The old Moon got up early one morning</p>
<p>And the Sun slept soundly, tho’ snoring</p>
<p>“Say, chap, why’re you up so bloody soon”</p>
<p>Said John the Peasant to the old blue Moon.</p>
<p>“Oh, bother bollocks and other such shite,</p>
<p>I forgot which was morn and which was night”</p>
<p>Moaned the Moon and wanted to make things right</p>
<p>“I’ll go straight to bed, if the Sun sees me,</p>
<p>Oh, ‘pon my cratered conk, I’ll be right dead”</p>
<p>“That didn’t bloody rhyme” said John.</p>
<p>“Oh, fuck this” and then the Moon was gone</p>
