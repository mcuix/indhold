    <p>Whilst browsing through some of the linguistics that I own, I encountered this gem from Bjarke Frellesvig&#x27;s excellent A History of the Japanese Language, p. 371:</p>

<p>The inventories of forms used in these functions have changed over time, as have rules for their combinations. However, with a few exceptions the basic system of respect and humility has not changed much between OJ and cNJ. In Old Japanese, as opposed to later stages, ‘respect for subject’ could be used by the speaker about himself, e.g. wa ga tata-s-ere-ba I GEN stand- RESP - STAT . PROV ‘as I stand’ (KK 2), spoken by the god Yachihoko no kami no mikoto. This is referred to as ‘absolute [as opposed to relative] respect’ and disappeared in the transition to EMJ. Exaltation is ubiquitous in the literary prose texts from EMJ and early LMJ.</p>

<p>That is, we generally see in modern Japanese there being polite registers for elevating the object of speech, i.e. the one spoken to or referred to, or anything that is part of their social circle. The speakers themselves never use language to elevate their own status, it&#x27;s always lowering it through kenjougo (謙譲語, &quot;humble speech&quot;), since the system of keigo does not mechanically have a built in option to aggrandise the speaker.</p>

<p>That is you can say,</p>

<p>わたくしめは社長のお考えを尊敬しております</p>
<p>Watakushi-me wa shachou no o-kangae o sonkei shite orimasu</p>
<p>&quot;I, lowly one, humbly respect the opinion of the company president&quot;</p>

<p>You cannot say with a specific set of specialised verbs or conjugations, at least, something akin to &quot;One as great as I do respect our excellent president&#x27;s opinion&quot; - using verbs normally used to elevate the object, rather than the subject.</p>

<p>Doing so would produce the bizarre:</p>

<p>この俺様は社長のお考えを尊敬しておられるぞ！</p>
<p>Kono ore-sama wa shachou no okangae o sonkei shite orareru zo!</p>

<p>Where おられる and the like are only used about other people than yourself and your own personal, social circle.</p>

<p>Well, outside of the realm of fiction, where such rules are defenstrated for the sake of entertainment, you can&#x27;t.</p>

<p>But you could at one point during the Old Japanese period, as Frellesvig points out in the quote use a mode of absolute respect that only counts for the speaker to exhibit extreme self-confidence or ethos for that matter, fittingly as the speaker in the cited example is a god.</p>

<p>This mode has since become obsolete over the many centuries that has passed, so your only chance of even being remotely, formally assertive, if also regal, in Japanese language is rather limited, indeed.</p>
