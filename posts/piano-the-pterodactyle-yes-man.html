    <p>This being the first of April and an international day of pulling the proverbial appendage, I thought that we, however, ought for a moment pause for elegiacal thought for the fate of a fictional Yes-man of Japanese comic history, Piano of Dragon Ball, of Piccolo&#x27;s royal escort.</p>

<p>He, whose fate and life was cruelly ended at the hands of his collapsing demonic liege-lord&#x27;s body thrust towards him by a juvenile cosmic simian bent on stopping said lord&#x27;s political ambitions.</p>

<p>Akira Toriyama dedicated a total of 26 lines of dialogue, mostly divided in two categories - as befitting the role of a fictional Yes-man of a demonic monarch - 1) praising/worrying about His Majesty and 2) correcting impertinent louts about questioning His Majesty&#x27;s prowess.</p>

<p>His first lines are those of filial piety, voice towards his gastropodian Father-King, concerning the health in oviparously conceiving with industrious fecundity several new members to the growing royal escort:</p>

<p>いけません！！　大魔王さま</p>
<p>これいじょうタマゴをお生みになって体力を　つかわれるとますます老化が　進み　世界を手中におさめるまえに死んでしまいますぞ！</p>

<p>Ikemasen!! Daimaousama</p>
<p>Kore ijou tamago o o&#x27;umininatte tairyoku o tsukawareru to masu masu rouka ga susumi sekai o shuchuu ni osamerumae ni shinde shimaimasu zo!</p>

<p>&quot;You musn&#x27;t, Lord Demon King.</p>
<p>If Your Majesty uses any more of His physical strength on graciously birthing eggs, then He shall prematurely die of advanced old age before realising His conquest of the world!&quot;</p>

<p>Here he in perfect courteous manner uses the o-ni-naru pattern of transforming umareru (&quot;to give birth&quot;) into the reverential construction o-umi-ni-naru (&quot;the honourable personage conceives&quot;). A most decorous utterance of worry for the ageing verdant liege-lord.</p>

<p>Alas, when the diminutive Pilaf, a hired goon, and his associate question the combat prowess and likelihood of the Great Demon King Piccolo&#x27;s victory over a juvenile simian fighter, he voices these words:</p>

<p>ふっ　大魔王さまがあのていどでやられるとおもうのか？</p>

<p>Fuh daimaou-sama ga ano teido de yarareru to omou no ka?</p>

<p>&quot;Hmph, you lot think that the Lord Demon King would suffer defeat so easily?&quot;</p>

<p>Indeed, a most loyal sentiment, but alas, whilst fighting said simian insurrectionist for the second time, after His Majesty has been granted rejuvenation by the magical powers of a divine dragon&#x27;s septuple orbs,the piteous Piano perishes.</p>

<p>His moribund exclamation is a wah! (わ…！！！, wa...!!!), perfectly encapsulating the finite lifespan of a villain in a Dragon Ball story-arc.</p>

<p>Rest thou in peace, oh reptilian prince. May winged imps guide thee to an eternal place in the grand celestial choir of fictional Yes-men, amongst the august company of characters such as Mas Amedda, grand vizier of Emperor Palpatine of Star Wars fame, Grima Worm-tongue, fragile royal adviser of King Theoden of Rohan and Saruman the Istari, and numerous other erroneously-perceived-as-oleaginous helpers of figures of power.</p>
