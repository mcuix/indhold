    <p>It&#x27;s a common misconception that Street Fighter character, the amnesiac British soldier Cammy&#x27;s relationship to the mysterious main villain of the series, General Vega (&quot;Master Bison&quot; in the West), is a creepy one.</p>

<p>So, Cammy approaches Vega and asks him to tell the truth about her, since she entered the tournament to get some answers, at which point the General replies:</p>

<p>教えてやろう。お前は三年前、我が組織が送り込んだスパイだ。</p>
<p>Oshieteyarou. Omae wa sannen mae, waga soshiki ga okurikonda supai da.</p>
<p>&quot;I shall tell you. Three years ago, my organisation sent you as a spy.&quot;</p>

<p>She then steps back in sheer horror over this revelation, whereas in the English localisation it goes like this:</p>

<p>&quot;I had feeling for you! I did not try to kill you! You had an unfortunate accident and lost your memory! Don&#x27;t you remember? We were in love!&quot;</p>

<p>Which grossly mistranslates the original line and turns this ending into something truly grotesque.</p>

<p>I am honestly not sure why this happened, and why the localisation would warp the Japanese ending in this.</p>

<p>In the subsequent games in the series, she would be revealed to be the genetic clone of Vega and hence serve as a member of his personal army of soldiers to one day become his next host body.</p>
