    <p>~kudasai is no doubt a word that you have heard before if you have ever partaken of any Japanese media, where it is typically translated in dubs or subtitles as &quot;please (would you this favour for me)&quot;, but Japanese has more expressions and words like these and we will be going through most of them in this post.</p>

<p>This category of verbs are known as benefactives, that is words of a modality that conveys a wish or in cruder terms a politely phrased imperative. Hence, ~nasai as in gomennasai (御免なさい) is literally &quot;Do please forgive me,&quot; with nasai being the formal imperative form of nasaru (なさる, &quot;the sir/madam does&quot;), a reverential (sonkeigo) verb, but more than often the meaning of gomennasai is closer to &quot;excuse me&quot; or &quot;pardon.&quot;</p>

<p>This group of words could very well also be considered as &quot;polite imperatives.&quot;</p>

<p>We will not, however, be going through humble (kenjougo) verbs like itadaku (頂く, &quot;to humbly receive&quot;) in this article since its usage is wider and a bit more different than these benefactives.</p>

<p>-kudasai (下さい) - Derived from kudasaru (下さる, &quot;to deign to give&quot;)</p>
<p>-kudasaimase (下さいませ) - More formal version of the above.</p>
<p>-nasai (なさい) - From the nasaru (なさる, &quot;the sir/madam does&quot;).</p>
<p>-nasaimase (なさいませ) - More formal version of the above.</p>
<p>-nasaimashi (なさいまし) - Archaic variant of the above.</p>
<p>-asobase (遊ばせ) - Archaic and hyper-formal, derived from asobu (遊ぶ, &quot;to frolic, to play&quot;). More often than not used by courtiers towards their regent when asking either for favours or imploring.</p>
<p>-choudai (頂戴) - Semi-formal, literally a noun meaning &quot;reception&quot;, it is literally comprised of two ways of spelling the humble verb itadaku (&quot;to humbly ask for&quot;), the humble, kenjougo, form of morau (&quot;to get&quot;).</p>
<p>-goran (御覧) - Semi-formal, literally the reverential, sonkeigo, form of miru (&quot;to see&quot;), i.e. &quot;the sir/madam sees.&quot;</p>
<p>-tamae (給え) - In modern times a masculine and informal impeartive, but I briefly mentioned in a previous post its usage as a archaic benefactive verb in the sense of &quot;superior/god/ruler grants,&quot; hence you will still see it in media such as fantasy novels where ~tamae usually rounds off prayer-like commands or incantations.</p>
<p>-(i)rasshai (いらっしゃい) - From the reverential, sonkeigo, existential verb irassharu (いらっしゃる, &quot;the sir/madam is&quot;). A closely related cousin of this expression is irasshaimase (いらっしゃいませ), the more formal if old fashioned version of irasshai, that you will typically hear from shop-owners trying to persuade potential buyers into their shops.</p>

<p>These do in general go at the end of a verb (or a noun, in some cases) to transform it into the imperative or benefactive mood, but in the case of the formal imperatives, the honorific prefix o- or go- is placed to render it more polite, such as:</p>

<p>読める -&gt; お読めください</p>
<p>Yomeru -&gt; Oyomekudasai</p>
<p>&quot;Read&quot; -&gt; &quot;Please read&quot;</p>

<p>Or in the case of noun-based verbs:</p>
<p>了承する -&gt;  ご了承ください</p>
<p>Ryoushou suru -&gt; Goryoushou kudasai</p>
<p>&quot;To understand&quot; -&gt; &quot;Please understand&quot;</p>

<p>In some cases it could also be phrased goryoushu shite kudasai, where the shite is less formal, than the above, but still polite, where the shite is the so-called &quot;te&quot; form, or a combinatory form of sorts to connect verbs and create things such as compounds.</p>
