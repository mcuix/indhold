    <p>Japanese - as has been written previously on this blog - a profuse amount of reverential, humble and polite ways in the grammatical paradigm of keigo (respectful speech) to express the various situations, where formality is the focus.</p>

<p>Some of these words that are used also belong to the category of most polysyllabic kanji, three of these will be covered, and they will also have their etymology in regards to the kanji themselves and the words that they are used to write.</p>

<p>Thus we come to this trio:</p>

<p>Tatematsuru, tsukamatsuru and uketamawaru.</p>

<p>Each of these incorperates the suffixed verb matsuru which essentially means &quot;to humbly perform&quot;, but outside of keigo context means worship and is typically written as 祀る・祭る, and acts akin to the modern masu.</p>

<p>Tatematsuru (奉る, &quot;to humbly offer unto someone&quot;)</p>

<p>The kanji for this word literally means &quot;observance, dedicate, offer, present&quot;, i.e. presenting something in a reverential way to someone either physically or metaphorically. It is also an archaic and formal auxiliary verb being used profusely in epistolary keigo.</p>

<p>Tsukamatsuru (仕る, &quot;to humbly perform&quot;)</p>

<p>This verb functions in a way as a more archaic variant of 仕える (tsukaeru, &quot;to serve humbly&quot;), which rather formal, but also modern. The word is structurally longer and other than ficiton appears in historical polite correspondance.</p>

<p>Uketamawaru (承る, &quot;to humbly acquiesce, to humbly hear&quot;)</p>

<p>This five syllable or kana long humble utterance is amongst the longest in the Japanese language and its kanji is used in words such as 承知 (shouchi, &quot;knowledge, acceptance&quot;) thus underlining the meaning of the word&#x27;s sense of humble acquiescence - i.e. accepting despite personally or mentally not wanting to, especially when talking to someone that is your superior.</p>
