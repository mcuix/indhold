    <p>Final Fantasy is no stranger to royalty. In fact, in most cases the main playable cast will contain a prince, princess, king and queen either secretly or quite obvious - such as in the cases of the most recent numbered Final Fantasy game.</p>

<p>Previous games in the series also featured royalty, albeit in a spoilerous nature and as such - even if it is an older game - a fair warning is given here.</p>

<p>Therefore, I have long been wondering whence the &quot;Til&quot; part in the name of Garnet Til Alexandros XVII, better known by her civilian nickname Dagger. In Danish royalty there is a tradition to use the word &quot;til&quot; (lit. &quot;to&quot;) in the same manner as German &quot;von&quot; and French &quot;de&quot;, where in the cases of Denmark, it signifies someone within the closest royal family. Dagger&#x27;s real name therefore would mean &quot;Garnet (Princess to the House of) Alexandros&quot;. The numeral implies that she is the seventeenth in her line to be called Garnet as such.</p>

<p>The name in the Japanese original is:</p>

<p>ガーネット・ティル・アレクサンドロス17世</p>
<p>Gânetto Tiru Arekusandorosu Juunana-sei</p>
<p>&quot;Garnet Til Alexandros the 17th&quot;</p>

<p>ティル (tiru) also fits with how the Danish is close in pronunciation to the English word &quot;till&quot;, albeit with a lighter &quot;i&quot; sound.</p>
