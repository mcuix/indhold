    <p>When you refer to the anthropomorphic lump of snow, minerals, cloth and vegetables in Japanese there&#x27;s a few options:</p>

<p>Yukidaruma (雪達磨, lit. &quot;snow Bodhidharma&quot;) - Literally referring to one of the key figures in bringing Buddhism to Japan, this monastic moniker for the man of snow is also normally written as 雪だるま. More properly the last part daruma refers to diminutive wooden dolls that lack one painted eye, hence you fill said eye out when your wish has come true. The term is ultimately from the much longer name Bodaidaruma (菩提達磨), a phonetic-kanji rendering of his Sanskrit name.</p>

<p>Yukiningyou (雪人形, lit. &quot;snow doll&quot;) - Another term albeit not see as often.</p>

<p>Sunooman (スノーマン, &quot;snowman&quot;) - Literally from the English word, one that is popular, and it is also used for the official rendering of the British animated film featuring the flying member of this sapient species of water molecules.</p>
