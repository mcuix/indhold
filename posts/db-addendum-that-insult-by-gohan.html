  <section class="post-content">
    <p>During Son Gohan&#x27;s pivotal fight against Boo - essentially an ancient jinn, whilst he has attained a more powerful form and Gohan himself has awoken his latent qi, he spouts an insult:</p>

<p>ウスノロ…</p>
<p>Usunoro...</p>

<p>This has been infamously translated as &quot;retard&quot; by Stephen Simmons as the official North American subtitles for the video release.</p>

<p>The term is more ordinarily spelled 薄鈍 literally meaning &quot;diluted (and) foolish&quot;, but translating to &quot;simpleton/halfwit/fool.&quot;</p>

<p>Whether not any newer releases of the series have changed this is something I do not know.</p>
