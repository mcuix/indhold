    <p>A friend of mine asked me recently as to the origins of the Japanese name for the voluminous giver of gifts, Santa Claus.</p>

<p>A direct transcription of the name Santa Claus is サンタクロース (Santa Kurôsu), but he is typically referred to as サンタさん (Santa-san), literally something to the effect of &quot;Mr. Claus,&quot; but -san itself hasn&#x27;t the strictness that &quot;mister&quot; has in English and as such merely implies a level of familiarity or politeness.</p>

<p>The name of the saint, whose name inspired Santa Claus, Saint Nicholas of Myra, is rendered as 聖ニコラス (Sei Nikorasu), where 聖 (sei) literally means &quot;holy&quot; or &quot;sacred&quot;, but as a borrowed over usage from Church Latin is used as a suffix for saintly names.</p>

<p>Wikipedia refers to him as ミラの聖ニコラオ (Mira no Sei Nikorasu, &quot;Saint Nicholas of Myra), thus including the toponym joined with the genitive suffix の (no), that can work as a &quot;of&quot; as in English.</p>

<p>On a related note 聖 can also archaically be read as hijiri, referring to virtuous monks in the past, where the name literally means &quot;the one who knows the days (upon which to divine)&quot;, stemming in all likelihood from the even more archaic 日知り (hishiri, &quot;day-knowing&quot;).</p>

<p>The UK version of the gift-giver, Father Christmas is also rendered in katakana as ファーザー・クリスマス (Fâzâ Kurisumasu), though it is quite obscure compared to the name of his American colleague, Santa Claus - I could only really find articles referencing to how Australia celebrates Christmas as well as a very passing mention of the name, but not directly in Wikipedia&#x27;s Japanese entry on the character, it itself merely being a re-direct.</p>

<p>In the film Arthur Christmas, the 136 year old grandfather voiced by Bill Nighy, is affectionately called &quot;Grandsanta&quot; by those around him, which is translated in the subtitles as おじサンタ (Ojisanta, &quot;Grampa Santa&quot;) and in the dub itself merely as おじいちゃん (ojiichan, &quot;gramps/grandad&quot;), thus foregoing the nickname entirely, for the regular informal word for one&#x27;s own grandfather.</p>
