    <p>Since we are nearing the very end of the year, I thought it&#x27;d be very topical to give a detailed view over the various ways that you can in Japanese express felicitations for such occasion. And also, bask in the etymological joys of everything.</p>

<p>新年明けましておめでとうございま</p>
<p>Shinnen akemashite omedetou gozaimasu</p>
<p>This phrase literally breaks down as:</p>
<p>新年 (shinnen, &quot;New Year&quot;)</p>
<p>明ける (akeru, &quot;to open, to begin&quot;)</p>
<p>おめでたい (omedetai, &quot;[a matter of] congratulations&quot;)</p>
<p>Here seen as おめでとう, an adverbial form typically seen in extremely polite circumstances, especially when paired with ございます (gozaimasu, &quot;to be&quot;), the honorific version of ある (aru ,&quot;to be&quot;), though to be more precise this actually reflects ござる (gozaru), which you may have heard/seen in samurai-related drama/comics - though it is originally the honorific form of aru.</p>
<p>Hence all in all, rather literally translated:</p>
<p>&quot;Congratulations for the beginning of the New Year&quot;.</p>
<p>This greeting is only used after New Year has occurred, hence the &quot;beginning&quot; part. There are also informal varieties such as 明けましておめでとう (akemashiteomedetou) and the even shorter あけおめ (akeome), as well as merely:新年おめでとうございます (Shinnen omedetou gozaimasu).</p>
<p>Incidentally, 年明ける (toshi akeru) means &quot;a (new) year dawns&quot; is a related expression, using some of the same kanji.</p>

<p>謹賀新年</p>
<p>Kinga shinnen</p>
<p>Over in the more decorous side of things, this expression is only used in letters, and consists of 謹賀 (kinga, lit. &quot;reverently (wishing) congratulations&quot;) - Used here as &quot;expressing wishes of happiness&quot;, as well shinnen, which - as seen before - means &quot;New Year.&quot;</p>
