    <p>The various contraction of the existential verb, &quot;to be&quot;, are plentiful in English, but the one belonging to &quot;I am not&quot;, seems either lost or dialectal, i.e. &quot;ain&#x27;t&quot;, though this word hasn&#x27;t as sordid a past as grammatical pundits would have you believe.</p>

<p>During the 1620s the contraction &quot;amn&#x27;t&quot; appeared in written speech, and probably existed far earlier than that, due to the ubiquity and usage of such forms. The word was eventually worn down to &quot;an&#x27;t&quot; and then at last &quot;ain&#x27;t&quot;, this then coalesced with similar forms such as &quot;haven&#x27;t&quot; becoming &quot;han&#x27;t&quot; and then absorbed into &quot;ain&#x27;t&quot; due to h-dropping, which still is a prominent feature of World English.</p>

<p>African American Vernacular English, a great provider of terms into the popular English lexicon, made the last addition to the evolution of &quot;ain&#x27;t&quot;, applying to it the sense of &quot;did not&quot;.</p>

<p>This glorious chimera of existential and operative verbs would flourish in multiple negatives, which - again contrary to wide-held belief - was and still is natural feature of English. Even Geoffrey Chaucer, the much lauded innovator of English, used it.</p>

<p>Should we then accept &quot;ain&#x27;t&quot; as a part of formal, academic English? It seems rather improbable due to the rigid standards of that particular variety of English, but otherwise say it ain&#x27;t so, for this particular contraction. Hell, I an&#x27;t done with talking about it, though!</p>

<p>(ADD STUFF ABOUT PREJUDICE CONCERNING THE CONTRACTION, ALSO ADD MORE SOURCES THAT ARE NOT WIKIPEDIA, SINCE THIS MAY BE VERY AD VERBIM)</p>
