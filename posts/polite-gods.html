    <p>Gods and divine beings in Japanese fiction typically speak in two flavours of diction: 1) Archaic sounding language (with a dash of modern words here and there) and 2) Modern language, whereof the second category there is a subset where the gods speak purely in polite language almost never relenting on this unflinching courteousness.</p>

<p>No matter to whom they are talking, mortal or immortal. Higher or lower in the cosmic hierarchy.</p>

<p>One example shall suffice for this analysis: Princess Kaguya from Tecmo Koei&#x27;s Warriors Orochi series.</p>

<p>Why is it that gods even need to be speaking in polite language?</p>

<p>Let us take a look.</p>

<p>Kaguya-hime:</p>

<p>なんと鮮やかな戦ぶり……。時の許す限り、拝見いたしたく存じます</p>
<p>Nanto asayakana ikusa buri... Toki no yurusu kagiri, haiken itashitaku zonjimasu</p>
<p>&quot;Such deft war-arts.... I shall like to most humbly witness this along as time itself permits me.&quot;</p>

<p>Haiken (&quot;to humbly behold&quot;), itasu (&quot;to humbly do&quot;) and zonjiru (&quot;to humbly know&quot;), all of these three make up &quot;shall like to witness&quot; and as such also represents the most extreme that the kenjougo (&quot;humble speech&quot;) has to offer. And a perfect introduction!</p>

<p>She could as well have said, for the last part,</p>

<p>見たくて思います</p>
<p>Mitakuteomoimasu</p>
<p>&quot;(...) I want to see&quot;</p>

<p>Using the reguer miru (&quot;to see&quot;) and omou (&quot;to think&quot;), albeit in their polite forms and convey a neutral sense of politeness.</p>

<p>She is based off a lunar princess of the Japanese fairy-tale, The Tale of the Wood Cutter, telling the story of how a poor wood-cutter finds within the innermost part of a bamboo shoot a young child that quickly grows to become a radiantly beautiful princess, hence the name kaguya which anciently meant a &quot;bright night.&quot;</p>

<p>Now, Kaguya is, granted, an exception since she also uses archaic elements such as the negation nu. Her personal pronouns watakushi and anata-sama are nonetheless marks of the most reverential language possible within Japanese, though the formality is rarely seen.</p>

<p>Her status as stellar and ancient nobility prompts her to speak in such a old fashioned manner of politesse.</p>

<p>She, even when admonishing other gods or mortals for their immoral conduct keeps her courteous tone:</p>
