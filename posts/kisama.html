    <p>The pronoun that started life as a courteous literary reference to one&#x27;s superiors that then dropped in social esteem to become the almost clichéd &quot;you bastard&quot; of pop-culture has a varied history - and I thought that it&#x27;d be interesting to delve into this evolution, just to show how semantic shifts can radically change the meaning of a word over a period of time.</p>

<p>Going by the kanji 貴様 alone, &quot;esteemed appearance&quot;, one would be absolutely baffled as to why on Earth this pronoun nowadays is used in pop-culture as vocal sucker-punch. Unlike the terms &quot;bastard&quot; and &quot;mother-fucker&quot;, this term does not imply any mode of natal questioning nor sordid actions, rather it somewhat mirrors the similar slide in respectability of other Japanese pronouns such as omae, lit. &quot;honoured front&quot; - referring to the presence of a noble - which in modern times is merely an informal &quot;you&quot;.</p>

<p>The kanji 貴 (&quot;precious/esteemed&quot;) also appears in similar polite 2nd person pronouns: 貴方 (anata, &quot;esteemed personage/direction&quot;), 貴殿 (kiden, &quot;esteemed hall&quot;), 貴公 (kikou, &quot;esteemed duke&quot;) and so on, where the last two are effectively archaic, though kiden still lingers as an extremely formal way of literary address.</p>

<p>Hence, it belongs to a long lineage of honorific &quot;you&quot;, but like omae - which also uses a kanji commonly found in honorific nouns 御 (&quot;o&quot;), repeatedly usage over the centuries has worn away its original meaning.</p>

<p>During the 1680s, we see it used as a pronoun denoting light respect, it would continue like this throughout the 1940s, with its usage in the military as a standard pronoun.</p>
