    <p>Elden RIng is not unknown for being a melting pot of mythological references to Germanic and Celtic cultures, and one of the more cryptic if also obvious ones take the shape of the Jar folk.</p>

<p>The living Jars of Elden Ring are curious creatures, essentially wobbling ceramic containers with large arms and tiny legs that dot the landscape of the game, two of which feature strongly in the game&#x27;s story.</p>

<p>Alexander the Iron Fist, self-styled Warrior Jar and Champion, is the game&#x27;s jovial stalwart, where in other games the archtype was represented by Siegmeier, Siegward and his daughter Sieglinde, all amiable knights garbed in bulbous armour that vow to adhere to a code of chivalry despite seemingly having a terrible sense of direction and a foggy mind.</p>

<p>Alexander is part Humpty Dumpty and part Roman clay-ware. A fragile exterior that hides the bodies and souls of many brave heroes that fule the peculiar construct, of which there are many.</p>
