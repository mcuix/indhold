    <p>Goku – a character from Akira Toriyama&#x27;s fantasy manga Dragon Ball, who usually uses ora (オラ, a rural first person singular pronoun) – switches to ore (オレ), the standard first person singular pronoun in Japanese when it comes to informal and assertive conversation, when he turns into the Super Saiyan for the first time during the last segments of the fight against the intergalactic tyrant, Freeza.</p>

<p>こんどはこのオレがきさまを滅ぼす</p>
<p>Kondo wa kono ore ga kisama o horobosu</p>
<p>&quot;Now I will be destroying you, bastard.&quot;</p>

<p>He repeatedly and uniformly uses this whenever he enters this golden haired state, and likewise when he switches back to his usual self likewise he switches back to ora. It is only much later during the cyborg arcs that he through training gains clarity of mind and consistently uses orawhen normal and transformed. Similarly the second person pronouns that he uses whilst transformed prior to training are omae, kisama and anta (おまえ・きさま・あんた), all rough and extremely rude pronouns – depending on context – whereas his regular self almost always uses omee (おめえ), a slurred form of omae – though he will uses kisama, when utterly angered.</p>

<p>The pronouns ora and omee are also associated with the Tohoku dialect of Japan, whence Goku derives many of his linguistic mannerisms such as turning the positive and negative particles ii and nai (いい・ない) into ee and nee (ええ・ねえ), likewise with diphthongs such as /ae/, /oi/, /ei/ and /ai/ are all turned into /ee/.</p>

<p>This trait is also wholly removed when he transformed, since he speaks what approximates to standard informal, if rough and rude, male Japanese language.</p>

<p>おまえは　もう　あやまってもゆるさないぞ…</p>
<p>Omae wa mou ayamatte mo yurusanai zo...</p>
<p>&quot;I will not permit the likes of you to do that&quot;</p>

<p>His regular self for comparison sake, which appears briefly in the fight against the tyrant himself:</p>

<p>二度と　悪さ　すんじゃねぇぞ</p>
<p>おめえのツラはもうみたくねぇ</p>
<p>Nido to warusa sunjanee zo</p>
<p>Omee no tsura wa mou mitaku nee</p>
<p>&quot;Ya ain&#x27;t gonna be doin&#x27; evil a second time!</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t wanna see yer mug ever again!&quot;</p>

<p>It is significant then that it is kept consistent, and when he finally does achieve a greater mastery over his transformation, then it also signifies an important part of Son Goku&#x27;s character development within the series itself.</p>
