    <p>In Elden Ring, one of the bosses that you can encounter is a ogreish warrior known as Margit the Fell Omen, which in Japanese corresponds to: 忌み鬼マルギット (Imi Oni Marugitto, &quot;Shunned Oni Margit&quot;).</p>

<p>Oni here doesn&#x27;t literally refer to the mythical creature itself, but moreover to the idea of Margit being shunned because of his monstrous appearance. &quot;Fell&quot; reappears throughout Elden Ring as a consistent localisation choice for 忌み (imi, &quot;shunned, prohibited, taboo&quot;), derived from the verb 忌む (imu, &quot;to detest&quot;). Related is also the adjective 忌々しい (imaimashii, &quot;provoking, annoying&quot;). All in all this suggests that Margit was not just unwanted, but thoroughly reviled because of his horned looks - which bode ill in the mythology of the game.</p>

<p>Fell in English is an archaic word meaning &quot;ruthless, savage&quot; (derived from Middle English fell (&quot;angry, fierce&quot;), and in general describes something monstrous or ill-boding:</p>

<p>But my heart forbodes that, ere all is ended, you, Frodo son of Drogo, will know more of these fell things than Gildor Inglorion.</p>
<p>(Lord of the Rings - Fellowship of the Ring, Tolkien)</p>

<p>&quot;Fell things&quot; here referring to the hordes of Mordor, warped and cursed beings that all serve the eponymous Lord of the Rings, Sauron.</p>
