    <p>Playing through the Japanese version, Super Famicom, of Konami&#x27;s great arcade game, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles Through Time, I noticed amongst other things that there were the small speech bubbles that appear whenever the Turtles, for example, fall into a manhole, they will come with a witty one-liner, such as:</p>

<p>&quot;われに  ひかりを！&quot; (Ware ni hikari o, &quot;Grant me light!&quot;), which strikes me as oddly archaic with &quot;ware&quot; (われ, or 我・吾 in two kanji variants) itself being of ancient lineage way back to the Old Japanese pronouns, itself meaning the first person pronoun in the singular.</p>
