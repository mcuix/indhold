    <p>Fighting games play host to a myriad of characters, and more often than not they will have names that may sound utterly flabbergasting, some of these such as Rugal Bernstein from the many fighting games of SNK, and Rolento F. Schugerg from Capcom&#x27;s Street Fighter (originally stemming from Final Fight).</p>

<p>Some times they are artefacts from transmitting names from one mode of writing to another, such as with Japanese famously not distinguishing between &lt;l&gt; and &lt;r&gt;.</p>

<p>These two in particular require more in depth explanations, stemming from what appears to be the old Babylonian kings and the other from a combination of a Japanese manga and German names.</p>
