    <p>ELDEN RING SPOILERS ARE PRESENT WITHIN THIS POST.</p>

<p>Within Elden Ring, there are certain lupine humanoids who serve as either helpful or antagonistic characters towards the player, it is later revealed that all of these, two in fact, are essentially loyal servants created for what the game terms Empyreans, i.e. a race of divine creatures. What differences are there with the Japanese version and the English localisation? Let us find out.</p>

<p>We will dwelve into the two principal lupine characters of the game, Blaidd and Malekith.</p>

<p>Blaide:</p>

<p>Named after the Welsh word for wolf, pronounced with a final &quot;v&quot; for the last &quot;d,&quot; this is also evident in the Japanese version of his name, ブライヴ, buraive, though the word also looks similar in spelling to &quot;blade,&quot; serving as a reference to his role in regards to Rani.</p>

<p>This character looks for all intents and purposes like a werewolf version of the main character, Gutts, from Berserk: A tall muscular warrior clad in iron armour and wielding a massive sword, a lump of steel with the vaguest semblance of a cutting edge.</p>

<p>His personality is fairly amiable, if rough, and he initially meets the player in a mossy forrest whereafter you help him dispatch of a rogue knight. It is later revealed that Blaid originally was created as the bodyguard and servant to Princess Rani, a witch who appears throughout the game, wanting to change the world&#x27;s cosmic order.</p>

<p>To that point, Blaid has been hardwired with a fail-safe, where should his master decide to go against the wishes of the divine people, he would be forced to go berserk and slay his former master for their defiance.</p>

<p>Iji, an old smith and tactician to the royal household, imprisons Blaid in a magical gaol, so that we will not be able to be frenzied once Rani&#x27;s plan is continued. The rest of the narrative ends with the player ultimately slaying the now mad Blaid, thus stopping him from completing his directive.</p>

<p>Personality-wise Blaid uses the pronoun ore (俺) and his second pronouns are chiefly omae (お前) and kisama (貴様), the former informal and the latter hostile. He uses kisama (akin to English &quot;you bastard&quot;), when first meeting the player thinking them of being a danger, but quickly switches to omae, when he realises that this is not the case:</p>

<p>…誰だ、貴様？</p>
<p>... Dare da, kisama?</p>
<p>&quot;Who the hell are you?&quot;</p>

<p>And later, after a boss fight:</p>
<p>…お前、凄まじい戦い様だったな</p>
<p>... Omae, susamajii tatakai you datta na</p>
<p>&quot;You had terrific battle back there!&quot;</p>

<p>He uses archaic traits like the positive particle yoi rather than ii, but his overall language is much less stifled and formal than the other knights.</p>

<p>The item descriptions gives us the following details, that elaborate on his relationship with Rani.</p>

<p>(...)</p>

<p>Malekith, the Black Blade, aka. Grannque the Beast Cleric</p>

<p>Initially you meet this giant in the shape of the mendicant Grannque, whose silent demeanour and role as vendor of various beast-related magic skills belies a ferocious strength that appears once and again, whenever the currency that you give to him in order to unlock the spells, Death Root, takes it toll on his thirst for blood.</p>

<p>It is later revealed that his real idenitity is that of Malekith, a lupine knight whose role as shadow and servant of Queen Marika renders him one of the game&#x27;s last bosses.</p>

<p>(...)</p>

<p>His speech patterns are genuinely archaic, resorting to ware (我), an first person pronominal of Old Japanese stock, and onusihi (お主), an informal old-fashioned pronoun that isn&#x27;t too disrespectful either. Overall his tone is that of an ancient being.</p>
