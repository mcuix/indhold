    <p>Here is a quickie in regards to discovery I made in terms of a weird if interesting variant way of writing an old polite imperative or optative mode of constructing a verb, namely tamau (たまう, &quot;to beg [a superior] to grant [a wish]&quot;), which is typically written with the kanji 給 that anciently meant &quot;to bestow&quot;, but nowadays is used the verb mostly in its kana-writing is used as a masculine informal imperative.</p>

<p>It is a close relative of the reverential (sonkeigo) verb tamawaru (賜わる, to bestow/grant [as a superior does to his subordinates])</p>

<p>In one of the translations of Don Quixote, we encountered it written in a more decorous way - the eponymous knight&#x27;s main way of talking and acting is to emulate the ancient knight romances that he madly idolises to the point of becoming quixotic:</p>

<p>「我が姫君ダルシネアの君、我心靈（の全部）を捕へておはする姫君、御身を慕ひまひらす爲め、かばかり多くの辛酸を忍ぶ御身の奴隷、高貴なる心ばせを決して忘れ玉ふな」</p>

<p>&quot;Waga himegimi Darushinea no kimi, wagashinrei (no zenbu) wo tsukamaete owasuru himegimi, onmi wo shitaimairasu tame, kabakari ooku no shinsan shinobu onmi no dorei, kouki naru kokorobase wo kesshite wasuretamauna.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your Highness, O Princess, my lady Dulcinea! Whom my soul and heart (all of it) hath been held captive by, O Princess! For Your sake do I most humbly toil and pine, thus doth Your servant endureth numerous hardships! Pray, Your Highness, grant me the favour of never forgetting this my noble heart!&quot;</p>
<p>(&quot;Adventures of Don Quixote - Don Kihôtê Eigochuugaku Kishayakuchuu&quot;, 1921)</p>

<p>Here the good knight is daydreaming and supplicating his imaginary princess to pay attention to his travails as he tries to render himself a worthy knight for her honour. And fitting the language of the knight is cast in archaic polite speech - more to the point, the verb tamau is in the negative tamau (&quot;pray grant me (that you) not&quot; or &quot;please do not&quot;) -  is written with the kanji 玉 (tama, &quot;jewel, jade&quot;) which is homophone with the stem of the verb, but otherwise is rarely used as a verb, thus the pleasing phonaesthetic nuance of the kanji and sound elevate the good Don Quixote&#x27;s wish to even further levels of archaic politeness.</p>

<p>Also present is mairasu, an otherwise obsolete archaic humble verb meaning &quot;to endeavour humbly to perform,&quot; related to the modern mairu (参る, &quot;to humbly go forth&quot;) and serves as a precursor to the modern multi-purpose verbal ending -masu.</p>

<p>I will be covering more of the Don Quixote translations in future posts.</p>
