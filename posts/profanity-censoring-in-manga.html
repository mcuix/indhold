    <p>In the manga, “Hero Organization”, we follow the quest for mecha-based revenge of Leonidas Tyler and some of his fellow pilots. One especial scene, with its related call-back have apparent seen some light censorship in terms of swearing, namely that “fuck” has been rendered into a more verbose insult, surprised? Let’s look into things already.</p>

<p>Julia H. Sanada, a stern veteran of the forces, faces Leonidas in a test-fight and, when our heroes believes that he has destroyed his teacher’s mech, Sanada reveals herself with a massive rocket-launcher, ready to blast Leonidas’ mech apart.</p>

<p>Japanese:その腹にファックしてやる (sono hara ni fakku shite yaru)</p>
<p>Literally: I am going to fuck up your belly</p>
<p>Official: Now watch what this massive bazooka does to that soft underbelly of yours.</p>
<p>(Chapter 12)</p>

<p>And much later, Leonidas faces troopers who may or may not have killed Julia, to which he repeats her quote, albeit modified:</p>

<p>Japanese:その脳天にファックしてやる (sono nouten ni fakku shite yaru)</p>
<p>Literally: I am going to fuck up your dome</p>
<p>Official: Now watch what this massive cannon… does to that thick dome of yours!</p>
<p>(Chapter 16)</p>

<p>In both cases the original sense of “fucking [something] up” has been rendered into a verbose threat, rather than resorting to euphemisms such as “mess up” or even obscure slang such as “frak up”.</p>

<p>It removes the snappy roughness of the line, especially when coming from Leonidas who is otherwise a character denoted for his meeker demeanour than that of his peers.</p>

<p>The verb in question is, for those interested fakku suru, literally using the loan word fakku (ファック) from the English “fuck” in its sense of “destroy/mess up”, by applying the universal verb-suffix, suru (“to do”).</p>
