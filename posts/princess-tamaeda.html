    <p>Whilst researching for upcoming projects in relation to the next work to compare and analyse, I came across various Japanese translations of Andersen&#x27;s De Vilde Svaner (&quot;The Wild Swans&quot;) - which involves a young princess by the name of Elisa, who must save her eleven cursed brothers who have been turned into swans by her wicked stepmother, whose wiles has entranced Elisa&#x27;s kingly father.</p>

<p>Most Japanese versions render her name as eriiza (エリザ) in the katakana script, but one version in particular opts for giving her a Japanese name instead.</p>

<p>Wadagaki Kenzou (和田垣謙三, 1860 - 1919), whom is no stranger to this blog, since we covered his translation of The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes before, included a translation of the fairy-tale in the very same volume (published in 1910) that includes said tale of sacerdotal imperial swindling.</p>

<p>Here is the paragraph in question from the original Danish, the bracketed translation is mine:</p>

<p>Langt borte herfra, der hvor svalerne flyver hen, når vi har vinter, boede en konge, som havde elve sønner og én datter, Elisa.</p>

<p>(Far away from here, where the swallows fly to, when we have winter, lived there king who had eleven sons and one daughter, Elisa.)</p>

<p>And Wadagaki:</p>

<p>むかし、さる國の王様に、十二人の王子と、一番末の玉枝姫といふ、都合十二人のお子様がありました。</p>

<p>Mukashi, saru kuni no ousama ni, juuninin no ouji to, icibansue no Tamaeda-hime to iu, tsugou juuninin no o-ko-sama ga arimashita.</p>

<p>&quot;Long ago, in a distant land lived there a king who had eleven princes and in the very end his favourite daughter, who was called princess Tamaeda; all in all he had twelve children.&quot;</p>

<p>The reference to swallow, the boreal country and the emigration of said birds have all been abridged away to reduce the size of the fairy-tale, which is one of Andersen&#x27;s longer ones, though not at all the scope of The Snow Queen.</p>

<p>Most interestingly Elisa becomes Tamaeda-hime, whose name literally breaks down as &quot;princess jewelled twig/branch,&quot; which makes for a name that references nature, presumably Elisa&#x27;s original wintry home, and the kanji for jewel or jade, 玉, was anciently used to refer to the Imperial families of China and Japan, hence it could also be a reference to her status as royal princess.</p>

<p>The name is also constructed akin to the name of actual nobleladies both fictional and real, whereof the former has the selenian Kaguya-hime, for example. The word hime does not necessarily refer to the daughter of a monarch, but can also refer to the daughter of nobility.</p>

<p>The word itself is ultimately from a compound meaning &quot;daughter of the sun&quot; (Old Japanese &quot;pi no me&quot;), appearing as a common part of goddess names in Shintoism, and probably referencing its ancient usage as a title of nobility.</p>
