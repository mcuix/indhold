    <p>I wrote a while back about how a Japanese translator handled the adaptation of the term &quot;old sport&quot; in the seminal novel The Great Gatsby. This time around I have not just one, but three more translations of the term from their respective translations and the choices are interesting.</p>

<p>Kureha chose 尊公 (sonkou, lit. &quot;revered duke&quot;), an archaic honorific for another person&#x27;s father as well as a polite pronoun in its own right. Gatsby, emulating his older forbearer and thus speaking in the way of an elderly gentleman, covering up his actual rougher self.</p>

<p>Cutting to the chase, here are three new translations from across:</p>

<p>Satou Ryouichi (佐藤亮一, 1924-) uses 旧友 (kyuuyuu, &quot;old friend, old pal&quot;; lit. &quot;old friend&quot;). This does communicate the sense of them having been acquaintances for a long while, but is not as archaic as 尊公.</p>

<p>Ootuski Sabuoru (大貫三郎, 1916-2003) uses the informal 2nd person pronominal 君 (kimi), whose tone is that of &quot;friend, pal&quot;, and gives it the nonstandard reading of オールド・スポート (ôrudo supôto, &quot;old sport&quot;), adding in a note:</p>

<p>オールド・スポート　男は酒・賭事などの道楽を持っているのでこう呼ぶ。従って女には用いない。非常な親しみをしめす。</p>
<p>Old Sport - Men who gamble and drink as pastimes call each other this. It cannot be used for women. It displays an extreme degree of familiarity.</p>

<p>Nozaki Takashi (野崎孝, 1917-1995) uses 親友 (shin&#x27;yuu, &quot;close friend, buddy, bosom friend, crony, chum&quot;, lit. &quot;intimate friend&quot;), which certainly reflexes the wide range of connotations that old sport has, and it does imply a closer level of intimacy than that of 旧友.</p>
