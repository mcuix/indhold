    <p>In Natsume Soseki&#x27;s feline autohagiographical comedy, that predates a certain other plump cat&#x27;s self-musings, &quot;I am a Cat&quot; (Wagahai wa Neko de aru), his owner a writer and a friend are discussing a funny episode that their common friend had at a restaurant.</p>

<p>Kangetsu, the friend - being a cosmopolitan-minded man - fools the waiter that&#x27;s serving them into believing that there exists an exotic dish called the &quot;tochimenbou&quot; (とちめんぼう), itself literally referring to a roll-pin used in making certain noodles:</p>

<p>&lt;INSERT EPISODE&gt;</p>

<p>The joke is here that the word for the genre of comedy is derived a literal stick that you slap with and Natsume uses a word for a Japanese roll pin that&#x27;s used to flattened noodles, hence, the waiter is getting confused over Kangetsu constantly playing the prank on him by pretending that it&#x27;s the name of an exotic food, rather than literally being the punchline for a slapstick joke.</p>

<p>Hence, translating this joke as well as pun requires quite a bit of cross-linguistic-cultural handiwork. Essentially boiling down to:</p>

<p>Slapstick -&gt; Stick that you slap/roll with -&gt; Exotic food with the same name</p>

<p>This train of thought as well as translation-creativity seems to be rather difficult for some translators:</p>

<p>Ito and Wilson&#x27;s translation renders this with &quot;moat-bell&quot; and &quot;meat-ball&quot;, where the former is the fictional food and the latter is the food that the poor waiter thinks that his guests want.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this completely misses the point with the joke being a pun on slapstick comedy and instead merely convey&#x27;s Kangestsu&#x27;s facetious ridicule of him.</p>

<p>Other translations entirely forego this and either explain the literal word or annotate it, which certainly is a workable solution even though it breaks the flow of the story&#x27;s comedy with the intrusion of an intertextual comment.</p>
