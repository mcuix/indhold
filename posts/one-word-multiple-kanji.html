    <p>In Japanese you will from time to time encounter that a verb can be written synonymously with different kanji, but these meanings whilst sharing similarities can differ in usage.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>Tsukuru (つくる) – “to create/make”</p>

<p>作 – Making of smaller things.</p>

<p>造 – Making of medium/large things</p>

<p>創 – Making of larger things/life/creation.</p>

<p>Wakaru (わかる) – “to understand (by differentiation)”</p>

<p>分 – To understand, generally.</p>

<p>判 – To judge something</p>

<p>解 – To discern/solve/rationalise.</p>

<p>Omou (おもう) – “to think/feel (subjectively)”</p>

<p>思 – To think/feel about something, generally.</p>

<p>想 – To think/feel about something, personally/emotionally/subjectively.</p>

<p>Miru (みる) – “to see”</p>

<p>見 – To see, generally.</p>

<p>観 – To inspect.</p>

<p>看 – To watch over</p>

<p>診 – Of a doctor, to check/look at someone.</p>

<p>視 – To regard.</p>

<p>矚 – To look intently.</p>

<p>The very last one in miru is quite rare, but nevertheless, you may encounter it in archaic literature. Suffice to say, these nuances are largely contextual in spoken language, but in the written language the kanji can clarify, what meaning is meant.</p>

<p>In most cases they may just be written with a more commonly found kanji, regardless of these nuances, and instead the intended meaning is to be guaged from context.</p>
