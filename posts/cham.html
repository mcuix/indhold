    <p>English dialects provide a shocking array of variety as well as being time-bubbles that preserve otherwise ancient traits. West Country English is one such, that gives us a shortening of the first person singular.</p>

<p>In the Middle English period, the first person singular pronoun, &quot;I&quot; had an older form &quot;Ich&quot; - itself from the Old English ic, cognate to words such as he German &quot;Ich&quot;, which the medieval form coincidentally resembles, and Scandinavian &quot;jeg/jag&quot;.</p>

<p>Just like we in modern English have ways of contracting &quot;is/are/am&quot; with the pronouns that precede it, i.e. &quot;I&#x27;m&quot;, West English of this period also had, &quot;Icham&quot;, which later got shortened to &quot;cham&quot; in modern times.</p>

<p>It sadly seems to have died out, but it belongs to that elusive group of rare shortened forms of &quot;I am&quot;, which includes &quot;amn&#x27;t&quot;, itself the forefather of &quot;ain&#x27;t&quot;, and the Scottish &quot;amnae&quot;.</p>
