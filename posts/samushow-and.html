    <p>SNK has a long and time-honoured tradition of &quot;creative&quot; translations and this is primarily concerned with their fighting games that were released during the nineties.</p>

<p>Often these translations would reference American pop-culture, contain strange slang and sound completely unlike the line that was in the original.</p>

<p>We will taking a look at the character Tachibana Ukyou, a haiku-composing fencer from the game Samurai Spirits (released in the west as Samurai Shodown [yes, Shodown]), how his lines are in the original first game, and how the staff at SNK translated/localised his specific way of talking.</p>

<p>Inspired by the site, Mad SNK Project, which chronicles the special brand of game localisation SNK had with rendering their games into English, I thought I might have a go at this.</p>

<p>&quot;Stewed Peach&quot; - Warrior-Poet:</p>

<p>His victory lines are as follows:</p>

<p>Against himself:</p>
<p>‥‥‥お、同じ顔‥‥‥‥ゆ、ゆるせん！</p>
<p>.... O, onaji kao.... Yu, yurusen!</p>
<p>&quot;...The same f-face... U-Unpardonable...!&quot;</p>

<p>SNK: HEY! THAT&#x27;S MY FACE. YOU&#x27;RE MEAT, BEANHEAD</p>

<p>Thus Ukyou goes from speaking rather reticently and expressing indignation to sounding like an egocentric brat from a 90&#x27;s-tastic family comedy.</p>

<p>Otherwise, Ukyou generally just treats the opponent in his generic victory quotes with ellipses which SNK &quot;renders&quot; (read: adds lines where there is mostly stoic silence) with:</p>

<p>CLEAR YOUR THOUGHTS AND MAYBE YOU WILL WIN. NOT!</p>

<p>STOP SHAKING! ONE SLASH AND IT&#x27;S ALL OVER!</p>

<p>Again, turning him into some manner of puerile blabbermouth, whilst in the original Ukyou rarely speaks, only when the moment requires it.</p>

<p>His other quotes are as follows:</p>

<p>　げんげつに　ぬれる我が骸も　美かんなり　　　右京</p>
<p>Gengetsu ni nureru waga mukuro mo bi kan nari</p>
<p>&quot;By the crescent moon, my own soaked corpse, becomes beautiful&quot;</p>
<p>SNK: EVEV IF YOU IMITATE ME, YOU STILL CAN&#x27;T GET A DATE!</p>

<p>斬勝利</p>
<p>　ちりてのち　のざらす者の　悲しさよ　　　　　右京</p>
<p>　(THE MOMENT I DREW MY SWORD, THE FIGHT WAS OVER. HO-HUM.)</p>
<p>必殺技勝利</p>
<p>　ほろよいの　しらねの美酒に　べにはがね　　　右京</p>
<p>　(A PERFECT ATTACK AND DEADLY HANDSOME. I AM TOO MUCH!)</p>
<p>その他勝利</p>
<p>　あぶくよに　つなぐ脈こそ　かんろかな　　　　右京</p>
<p>　(YOU ALMOST SCRATCHED MY PERFECT FACE. OOOH, TO THINK OF IT!)</p>
<p>エンディング</p>
<p>　命脈が　ありて我が剣　かがやけり　　　　　　右京</p>
<p>　(LIFE IS A STEWED PEACH IN A LOT OF SYRUP･･･ UKYO.)</p>
