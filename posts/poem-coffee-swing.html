    <p>Here are some short poems from my upcoming poem collection that I am working on, said poems were written between 2020 and 2021, and is still being written on.</p>

<p>These in particular was after listening to some Billy Joel as well as reading Ginsberg, though not having the solemn gravitas of both, but rather more an emphasis on wit. I suppose there is also an element of the lyrics of the songs from the Roaring Twenties.</p>

<p>Coffee – The Stuff</p>

<p>Cool off with a cool cuppa</p>
<p>Even in the heat – blazes from the street</p>
<p>Stress warming those warm of heart</p>
<p>  So much so it smarts</p>
<p>“Give me some of the good stuff” quips they</p>
<p>“Sure thing, friend” comes it from the bloke</p>
<p>“Ah, sure’s cool to wade the heat off. You’re a warm soul, y’know” they reply.</p>
<p>“Ah… Keeping my head cool during these hot days is just my job” says He.</p>
<p>  Then the coffee’s gone cold.</p>
<p>  Thus repeats the repeat of the old.</p>

<p>It’s gotta have that Swing</p>

<p>Don’t give me all that jizz about not liking jazz</p>
<p>I wanna have that music with the grand pizzazz</p>
<p>Groving and moving to all those old time tunes</p>
<p>Beneath all the passing suns and the moons</p>
<p>Till every star bursts out dancing in the black</p>
<p>Yeah, w’regular, real, regal, right moves, no slack</p>
<p>Let’s then dance you and I,</p>
<p>Until the day dawns, till the working day bids</p>
<p>You and I goodbye</p>
<p>Oh, but I know a thing or to</p>
<p>About that they call “the Swing”</p>
