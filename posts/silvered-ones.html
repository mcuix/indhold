    <p>SPOILERS MAY OCCUR FOR ELDEN RING.</p>

<p>In Elden Ring there is a race of amphibian like humanoids along with slightly more elfin ones much further off, apparently an older variety of them, whose name in the English translation is albanaurics.</p>

<p>Later on in the game they are revealed to effectively be artificial humanoids created for the sole purpose of being a synthetic work force.</p>

<p>The key to this identity lies within the Japanese as well as English name.</p>

<p>In Japanese they are called shiroganebito (しろがね人, &quot;silver person&quot;), now the noun shirogane is usually spelled with the kanji 銀, lit. silver, and can also mean &quot;silver coloured.&quot; Thus &quot;argent person,&quot; as well as literally &quot;person of silver.&quot; Alternative ways of spelling the word are</p>
<p>白銀 (lit. &quot;white silver&quot;) and 白金 (lit. &quot;white gold/metal&quot;). Thus all points towards a people of luminously metallic hue, be it literally or in the case of the more ancient ones, their hair.</p>

<p>The english name is composed of two elements, alba and auric, that is from Latin albus, &quot;white&quot;, and aurum (&quot;gold&quot;), thus literally &quot;white gold&quot;, and equating to the variant Japanese kanji-spelling 白金, which literally means &quot;white gold,&quot; but properly signifies &quot;silver.&quot;</p>

<p>There is also a rare English adjective auric that means anything appertaining to or resembling the chemical element aurum, i.e. gold.</p>

<p>Thereby the translators of this game essentially created a brand new Latin derived compound noun to translate the Japanese word, thus creating the name for these elusive people.</p>

<p>It is worth remembering that the kanji 人, read as hito on its own and as -bito, -jin and -nin, when it compound nouns typically is used in demonyms (英国人, eikokujin - Englishman, lit. &quot;England Person&quot;) or word describing a profession (職人, shokunin, &quot;craftsman&quot;, lit. &quot;employment person&quot;).</p>
