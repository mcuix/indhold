    <p>Before ringing out the year 2022 and in with 2023, I thought I may make a quick post related to a classic Science Fiction franchise and its relation to the as classic tropes of naming characters:</p>

<p>Enter Doctor Emmet Lathrop Brown:</p>

<p>When we discuss naming characters in fiction, we typically see authors use the terms Cratylic and Hermogenic, the former relating to names that are given with a specific meaning in mind, and the latter those that are arbitrarily given. This is where Back to the Future fits the Cratylic mold rather perfectly.</p>

<p>Emmet Lathrop &quot;Doc&quot; Brown&#x27;s name is on the surface level one of two rather uncommon personal names plus a rather ordinary surname, which is the official reason given by Zemeckis and Gale.</p>

<p>The fact that they somewhat spell out &quot;time portal&quot;, when written backwards appears to be a happy accident, more than purposeful pun, however it still fits fortuitously. Brown&#x27;s own name could be in reference to the father of modern rocketry, Wernher Von Braun, since it is also mentioned that Doc&#x27;s father Anglicised the German surname to fit into society.</p>

<p>His unusual first name Emmett also fits the trend of other &quot;eccentric&quot; scientists such as Julius F. Kelp, Theophilus Branestawn and Ivo Robotnik.</p>

<p>&quot;Doc&quot; rounds it off as an old fashioned if informal way of referring to someone who either is a doctor, or has the traits of them.</p>

<p>Plus there is the echo of pulp magasine heroes in it, as well.</p>

<p>With that in mind, have a Happy New Year!</p>
