    <p>A quick word of update to quell any worries there might be. I am currently researching for a bigger comparison project, and also taking care of IRL problems that have been occurring.</p>

<p>The most recent research has been on the characteristics of speech of the cast of Street Fighter as well as some of KOEI&#x27;s Warrior/Musou games - suffice to say there are vast amounts of gaming text to plough through wherever they aren&#x27;t available in the form of guide-books that have transcribed in-game sources such as the victory quotes, typically displayed at the end of every match where the fighters that you have picked with quip or utter a phrase in regards to the fight that had happened.</p>

<p>Mars, the author and creator of The Mad SNK Project has an on-going project of charting SNK&#x27;s infamously bad and/or hilarious translations of their games and comparing these English localisations with the original Japanese ones, which reveal a certain predilection from SNK in the form of vintage dubious American slang and references to pop-culture, such as characters will sound completely different from their original counterparts.</p>

<p>I by all means urge you to check his stuff out.</p>

<p>You will in all likelihood be seeing a new article within next week.</p>
