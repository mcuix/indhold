    <p>Knights in original and dubbed material tend to take on characteristics that mix formal modern language and bushigo, i.e. pop-fictional samurai language. Thus nearly all of them use watashi as their first person reference, they will switch to something far more samurai-esque such as soregashi, when being extremely formal towards a lord, lady or monarch. Hence there is a distinct historical colouring, if affected, to convey how these medieval nobles talk.</p>

<p>The manga Berserk has no shortage of knights, and Azan, the monk-knight more or less serves as a perfect example. Beyond his rotund, but robust frame, he sports a gentlemanly moustache and has a massive pole-arm as his weapon of choice. He manner of speaking however is very reminiscent of samurai, preferring sessou (拙僧, &quot;clumsy monk&quot;) and gusou (愚僧, &quot;foolish monk&quot;) as his main modes of referring to himself, something paralled in the warrior-monks of Japanese pop-culture and cinema. Case in point, when he fights the main character in a duel, he introduces himself in this manner:</p>

<p>我は聖鉄鎖騎士団副団長アザン！！</p>
<p>字を鉄棍鬼アザンと申す！！</p>
<p>黒い剣士よ　いざ尋常に勝負！！</p>

<p>Ware wa seitessakishidan fukudanchou Azan! Aza wa tekkonki Azan to mousu! Kuroi kenshi yo. Iza jinjou ni shoubu!</p>

<p>&quot;I am vice-commander of the Holy Chain Knights, Azan!! My epipthet is Azan, the iron-cudgle demon!! Black swordsman! Huzzah! I challenge thee to close quarter  combat!&quot;</p>

<p>Here he uses 我 (ware), a first person pronoun of Old Japanese stock, for theatrical effect, when proclaiming his name and title, along with using the plain form of 申す (mousu, &quot;to humbly state/report/say/do&quot;), which further adds to his archaic flavour. Lastly he uses the stock phrase いざ尋常に勝負 (iza jinjou ni shoubu, lit. &quot;Now then, [let us have a] regular bout of combat&quot;), which has become famous as the sound first heard prior to any match in the Samurai Shodown series of fighting games.</p>

<p>Elsewhere he uses regular keigo, albeit with archaic pronominals such as おぬし (onushi, &quot;thou&quot;), そなた (sonata, &quot;thou&quot;) and 貴公 (kikou, lit. &quot;esteemed duke&quot;) the latter being a more formal and elevated mode of second person reference. One extremely favoured by the knights of From&#x27;s Souls series as well as countless other fantasy themed games and media. &quot;Onushi&quot; and &quot;sonata&quot; are both semi-informal and still imply an air of respect from the speaker towards their audience, though &quot;onushi&quot; could be regarded as the most informal, akin to a modern お前 (omae).</p>

<p>It should be noted that knights in English, too, stereotypically speak some quasi variety of Shakespearean or Chaucerian English – paralleling the affected archaic tone in the Japanese fiction.</p>
