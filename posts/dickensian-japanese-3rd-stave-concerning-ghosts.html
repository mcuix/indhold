    <p>Ghost:</p>

<p>Within A Christmas Carol, Dickens uses several for the numinous remnants of the dead, apparition, spirit, phantom, spectre and ghost. These terms are nearly unique in their semantics, whereof spirit and ghost are used synonymous, and apparition, spectre and fathom when referring to the supernatural creatures as ominous beings.</p>

<p>The three supernatural Christmas visitors (not including Marley himself) are called ghost in the chapter headings, but referred internally as spirit, when not referring to their own identity, i.e. Ghost of Christmas Present and so on.</p>

<p>How then does the Japanese translators approach these distinct terms?</p>

<p>This will be illuminated in the comparisons as we go through the three individual ghosts, as well as Marley&#x27;s spectre when we proceed with the ghosts themselves.</p>
