West Country English is one such, that gives us a shortening of the first person singular.</p><p>In the Middle English period, the first person singular pronoun, "I" had an older form "Ich" - itself from the Old English <em>ic</em>, cognate to words such as he German "Ich", which the medieval form coincidentally resembles, and Scandinavian "jeg/jag". </p><p>Just like we in modern English have ways of contracting "is/are/am" with the pronouns that precede it, i.e. "I'm", West English of this period also had, "Icham", which later got shortened to "cham" in modern times.</p><p>It sadly seems to have died out, but it belongs to that elusive group of rare shortened forms of "I am", which includes "amn't", itself the forefather of "ain't", and the Scottish "amnae".</p>

            <article id="xmas-article-the-little-match-girl-translation-comparison" class="gh-post" data-search-content=" hans christian andersen's tragic story, from 1845, of the young girl who succumbs a wintry death whilst comforting herself with visions of warmth and at last the spirit of her late grandmother, has become not just a literary classic, but also the match-girl herself has become a symbol of the fragility of life.  how then do japanese translators handle this sensitive tale of the poor girl?  i'll be looking at how they handle the final scene, wherein the girl makes a heartfelt plea to the spirit of her deceased grandmother to take her along to the starry heavens because she misses her dearly - in this pivotal moment we also see what can be called a summary of all of the elements that appears in the narrative itself:  the three visions: 1) the oven, 2) the roasted goose, 3) the christmas tree. each of which frame the typical dream of an ideal danish christmas time, and contrasts itself with the girl's plight.  the prayer also serves as the narrative endnote of the girl's desperation - omitting this part would seriously defang the story of its tragic intention.  i will be comparing the following versions:   the 1886 translation by hei'ichi nakazawa (中沢柄一), first published in the 3rd issue of the literal translation of the new national text book (ニューナショナル第三読本直訳). this is the very first translation of the fairy tale and as such marks an interesting point of comparison for the subsequent ones. it is written purely in an archaic, formal and stilted language.  the 1908 translation by hyakushima sou (百島操), features unique characteristics and compared to the first one is more or less in a colloquial language.  the 1967 translation by yazaki genkurou (矢崎源九郎).   for reference here is the original danish version:  &quot;mormor!&quot; råbte den lille, &quot;oh tag mig med! jeg ved, du er borte, når svovlstikken går ud; borte ligesom den varme kakkelovn, den dejlige gåsesteg og det store velsignede juletræ!&quot;   &quot;'grandmother!' shouted the little one. &quot;oh, please take me with you, i know that you are gone as soon as the match fades out. gone just like the warm stove, the nice roasted goose and the big blessed christmas tree&quot;  (own translation)  &quot;kakkelovn&quot; is stove, &quot;gåsesteg&quot; is literally &quot;goose-stake&quot; and &quot;juletræ&quot; is &quot;christmas tree&quot;, or more literally &quot;yule tree&quot;, which has the adjective &quot;velsignede&quot; - &quot;blessed&quot; or even &quot;consecrated&quot;, since &quot;at velsigne&quot; means to &quot;bless/consecrate&quot; - mostly here just to elevate it to a hallowed/splendid status.  notice how it's not &quot;den lille pige&quot; (the little girl), but &quot;den lille&quot; (the little one), that's used to highlight her diminutive status compared to the grand spectacle before her.   1886 - nakazawa   the prayer:  小サキ女兒カ叫ヒシ祖母、オー汝ト共ニ私ち取レヨ。調度温カナル暖爐、炙シタル鵞、及ヒ耶蘇降生日ノ樹ノ如ク燧火木カ燃去テアルヤ否ヤ汝カ消失セルデアラウコト私カ知ル   chiisaki joji ga sakebishi sobo, oo nanji to tomo ni watakushi wo toreyo. choudo atatakanaru danro, abisitaru ga, oyobi yaso-koujoubi no ki no gotoku no suihibi ga moetesatte aru ya ina ya nanji ga shoushitsu seru de arou koto watakushi ga shiru.   &quot;the little girl cried out to her grandmother, 'oh, take me with thee. i know that thou wilt disappear just as the warm fireplace, the roasted goose, and the tree of  the day of the birthday of jesus.'&quot;  it's worth noting that the phrase 燧火木カ燃去テアル had 燃去 (&quot;burn away&quot;) glossed with the english-inspired furigana/ruby &quot;barun auto&quot; (バルン、アウト), to signify to the reader of the story that it is originally from an english translation/text. this is a recursive thing for the translation in general, and in some cases there are double sided (!) furigana, i.e. one giving the anglicised reading and the other the native japanese one.   moving on.  the stove is translated as  danro  (&quot;stove/fireplace&quot;), goose is  ga , using the one of two kanji making up the ordinary name for the bird 鵞鳥, &quot;gachou&quot;, typically written phonetically as ガチョウ in modern japanese. christmas tree however sees quite a verbose rendering &quot;耶蘇降生日ノ樹&quot; (yaso-koujoubi no ki), literally &quot;the tree of the day of the advent of the birth of jesus&quot;.  the girl herself speaks rather archaically using &quot;nanji&quot; (thou) when referring to the grandmother and using the rather formal &quot;watakushi&quot; to refer to herself. this may strike as a strange combination of an otherwise ordinary formal pronoun with the archaic &quot;nanji&quot;, but it is an otherwise common trait in this manner of rendering.   1908 - hyakushima   あれ祖母様、マッチの消えて了はない中に何卒か私を貴女と一緒に連れて行って下さい、まへの焚火や、御馳走や、クリスマス樹のやうに消えて了はない中に   are obaasan, macchi no kiete shimawanai naka ni douka watashi wo anata to issho ni tsurete itte kudasai, mae no takibi ya , gochisou ya, kurisumasu tsurii no you ni kiete shimawanai naka ni   &quot;oh, granny! please take me with you whilst the match has yet to burn out! just like back when the open fire, feast and christmas tree was there!&quot;  the underlying kanji for the otherwise ordinary reading &quot;obaasan&quot; (granny/grandma) is the highly decorous obaasama (祖母様, &quot;dearest grandmother&quot;).  the language is otherwise very polite with the &quot;~ kudasai&quot; (&quot;please if y">

Gone just like the warm stove, the nice roasted goose and the big blessed Christmas Tree"</em><br>(Own translation)</p><p>"Kakkelovn" is stove, "gåsesteg" is literally "goose-stake" and "Juletræ" is "Christmas Tree", or more literally "Yule Tree", which has the adjective "velsignede" - "blessed" or even "consecrated", since "at velsigne" means to "bless/consecrate" - mostly here just to elevate it to a hallowed/splendid status.</p><p>Notice how it's not "den lille pige" (the little girl), but "den lille" (the little one), that's used to highlight her diminutive status compared to the grand spectacle before her.</p><p><strong>1886 - Nakazawa</strong></p><p>The prayer:</p><p>小サキ女兒カ叫ヒシ祖母、オー汝ト共ニ私ち取レヨ。調度温カナル暖爐、炙シタル鵞、及ヒ耶蘇降生日ノ樹ノ如ク燧火木カ燃去テアルヤ否ヤ汝カ消失セルデアラウコト私カ知ル</p><p><em>Chiisaki joji ga sakebishi sobo, oo nanji to tomo ni watakushi wo toreyo. Choudo atatakanaru danro, abisitaru ga, oyobi Yaso-koujoubi no ki no gotoku no suihibi ga moetesatte aru ya ina ya nanji ga shoushitsu seru de arou koto watakushi ga shiru.</em></p><p>"The little girl cried out to her grandmother, 'Oh, take me with thee. I know that thou wilt disappear just as the warm fireplace, the roasted goose, and the Tree of  the Day of the Birthday of Jesus.'"</p><p>It's worth noting that the phrase 燧火木カ燃去テアル had 燃去 ("burn away") glossed with the English-inspired furigana/ruby "barun auto" (バルン、アウト), to signify to the reader of the story that it is originally from an English translation/text. This is a recursive thing for the translation in general, and in some cases there are double sided (!) furigana, i.e. one giving the anglicised reading and the other the native Japanese one. </p><p>Moving on.</p><p>The stove is translated as <em>danro </em>("stove/fireplace"), goose is <em>ga</em>, using the one of two kanji making up the ordinary name for the bird 鵞鳥, "gachou", typically written phonetically as ガチョウ in modern Japanese. Christmas Tree however sees quite a verbose rendering "耶蘇降生日ノ樹" (Yaso-koujoubi no ki), literally "the tree of the day of the advent of the birth of Jesus".</p><p>The girl herself speaks rather archaically using "nanji" (thou) when referring to the grandmother and using the rather formal "watakushi" to refer to herself. This may strike as a strange combination of an otherwise ordinary formal pronoun with the archaic "nanji", but it is an otherwise common trait in this manner of rendering.</p><p><strong>1908 - Hyakushima</strong></p><p>あれ祖母様、マッチの消えて了はない中に何卒か私を貴女と一緒に連れて行って下さい、まへの焚火や、御馳走や、クリスマス樹のやうに消えて了はない中に</p><p><em>Are obaasan, macchi no kiete shimawanai naka ni douka watashi wo anata to issho ni tsurete itte kudasai, mae no takibi ya , gochisou ya, kurisumasu tsurii no you ni kiete shimawanai naka ni</em></p><p>"Oh, granny! Please take me with you whilst the match has yet to burn out! Just like back when the open fire, feast and Christmas Tree was there!"</p><p>The underlying kanji for the otherwise ordinary reading "obaasan" (granny/grandma) is the highly decorous obaasama (祖母様, "dearest grandmother").</p><p>The language is otherwise very polite with the "~ kudasai" ("please if you would").</p><p>The stove has become an "open fire", the goose a "feast", and the Christmas Tree this time is rendered in a slightly more modern manner, with the kanji "ki" being read in English as "tree."</p><p><strong>1967 - Yazaki</strong></p><p>「おばあさん！」と、少女はさけびました。「ああ、あたしも、いっしょに連れていって！　だって、マッチの火が消えちゃえば、おばあさんは行っちゃうんで しょ。さっきの、あったかいストーブや、おいしそうな焼きガチョウや、それから、あの大きくて、すてきなクリスマスツリーみたいに！」</p><p><em>"'Obaasan!' to, shoujo ga sakebimashita. 'Aa, atashi mo, issho ni tsurete itte! Datte, macchi no hi ga kiechieba, obaasan wa icchaundesho. Sakki no, attakai sutoobu ya, oisisou na yaki gachou ya, sorekara, ano ookikute, suteki na kurisumasu tsurii mitai ni !'"</em></p><p>"'Oh, granny!', the girl shouted. 'Ah, take me with you! Because as soon as the fire burns out, then you'll also be completely gone. Just like the warm stove, the delicious roasted goose and, then, like the giant, pretty Christmas Tree!'"</p><p>We see that the term for the grandmother remains the same, the girl this time around has wholly informal feminine language, complete with "atashi", the colloquial form of "watashi", as well as shortening the sentence copula "でしょう" (deshou, "seems to be") to でしょ (desho). </p><p>The terms this time around are mostly different, with the loan word ストーブ (sutoobu) being "stove", 焼きガチョウ ("yaki gachou", lit. "roasted goose") for the goose and Christmas Tree this time around is wholly rendered into the phonetic katakana クリスマスツリー (kurisumasu tsurii).</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p><p>Overall the translations showcased here show a transition not only orthographically with katakana being ditched in favour of hiragana as well as the characterisation of the girl changing from speaking in a stilted archaic fashion to polite to childishly informal. Likewise the terms evolve from kanji-heavy to straight up phonetic renderings of either loan-words or pre-existing ones.</p><p>The rendering of her plea into a more informal register helps communicating her plight rather than having her speak in a stilted and extremely archaic manner that doesn't show her as this genuinely destitute little girl.</p>

            <article id="goukis-sf6-shungokusatsu" class="gh-post" data-search-content=" note: this is an updated and wholly rewritten version of a blog post that i wrote a week or so ago, when the trailer for gouki/akuma’s inclusion into the cast of sf6 was published. the former blog post was riddled with mistakes, this has been ameliorated.  within the trailer gouki performs his signature move, the  shungokusatsu  (“instant hell slaying”) and recites a short poem, with accompanying kanji that shows what he says.  (1) 一瞬千撃 (2) 抜山蓋世 (3) 鬼哭啾啾 (4)故豪鬼成   (1) isshun sengeki, (2) batsuzan gaisei, (3) kikoku shuushuu, (4) yue ni goku nari   on a surface level, you could translate it as,   (1) delivering a thousand strikes in an instant,    (2) i uproot mountains and overshadow worlds,    (3) making ghosts constantly cry and wail,    (4) therefore i am gouki   the official dub renders it as:   (1) die a thousand deaths    (2) usurp the heavens    (3) embrace the sorrow    (4) become the demon   already now, i am sure that you’ll see that there are differences between the initial direct translation and the localisation by capcom’s english team.  therefore, treating each of these lines – verses of poetry, if you will – individually, to show how they are references to classical chinese literature as well as gouki’s appearance in the official sf3 manga by masahiko nakahira.  before moving in, it’s worth noting that each of the 4 lines are composed of 4 kanji and as such initially look great, but whereas the first three are purely read via the chinese-inspired  on-yomi reading, the last is read in the japanese-inspired  kun-yomi reading, and as such breaks the flow/rhythm/structure of the poem itself – the last one is more specifically  kun-doku , i.e. translating classical chinese into classical japanese, as will be explained when we reach the fourth line.  i will include the literal translation for each line aside it in the title.   1. 一瞬千撃, lit. one-instant-thousand-strike(s)   “a thousand strikes in one instant” stems from the sf4 iteration of his shungokusatsu, where said kanji appear as he strikes a   niou   pose signifying the literal nature of the attack hitting numerous times in a flash. this could in turn stem all the way back to the sf3 manga.  the niou themselves being fierce guardian dieties, whose very appearance gouki himself closely resembles right down to posing and physical features.  translating it as “die a thousand deaths”, whilst dramatic and certainly fitting gouki’s overall personality, feels like an exaggeration of the “thousand strike” that he will deliver.   2. 抜山蓋世, lit. pull-mountain(s)-cover-world(s)   this line derives from 史記・項羽本紀 (shi jie: book of xian yu):   力拔山兮氣蓋世，時不利兮騅不逝。騅不逝兮可柰何，虞兮虞兮柰若何！    xian yu , a king of western chu, is trapped by liu bei’s forces and composes this song.  in burton watson’s translation:   my strength plucked up the hills,/my might shadowed the world;/but the times were against me,/and dapple runs no more;/when dapple runs no more,/what then can i do?/ah, yu, my yu,/    what will your fate be?  (watson, v. 1, p. 45)  the pertinent passage being:  力拔山兮氣蓋世  (lit. strength-pull-mountain-emph, spirit-cover-world)  whence the japanese idiom 抜山蓋世 derives, in its modern meaning of “having herculean strength.”  the english’s dub, “usurp the heavens”, makes gouki sound very luciferian – thus them making a rather direct reference to the meaning of akuma, his english name. where the original line merely references gouki highlighting his own superhuman strength and power.   3. 鬼哭啾啾, lit. ghost-wail-cries.   note that “cries” are literally a reduplication of the character for “cry” to create a plural.  this refers to a line from the tang-era poem “the ballad of war carts” by du fu, which refers to a peasant-conscript joining the imperial army and experiencing the battlefield first hand. the last two lines of the poem are:   新鬼煩冤舊鬼哭    天陰雨濕聲啾啾   “where new ghosts are troubled by the cries of the old  the sky is gray, it rains, it’s wet, and all about, the sound of constant wailing”   (translation by traditionshome, ll. 33 – 34)   hence abbreviating the entire last phrase into “the constant wailing of crying ghosts.”  the japanese idiom, 鬼哭啾啾 can therefore mean &quot;something spine-chilling.&quot;  “embrace the sorrows” sounds off point, where the original tactfully refers to the 鬼 (oni/ghost) part of his own name, lit. “mighty oni”.   4. 故豪鬼成, lit. therefore-gouki-be.   the line, when spoken by gouki himself, is:  yue ni gouki nari , “therefore i am gouki”, whilst this scans as archaic japanese, this is in truth somewhat clumsy. it looks great, because it goes 4-4-4-4, but upon reading this out it looks inelegant. four of the lines are read like classical chinese poetry ala  on-doku  (“sound reading”, i.e. reading as a middle chinese text), and the last line  “yue ni gouki nari ” is  kun-doku  (“semantic reading”, i.e. in japanese, as mentioned previosuly), hence, 故豪鬼成 ought to have been rendered as 故に豪鬼なり with  okurigana  (grammatical kana) – but is rendered in the for">

The former blog post was riddled with mistakes, this has been ameliorated.</p><p>Within the trailer Gouki performs his signature move, the <em>Shungokusatsu </em>(“instant hell slaying”) and recites a short poem, with accompanying kanji that shows what he says.</p><p>(1) 一瞬千撃 (2) 抜山蓋世 (3) 鬼哭啾啾 (4)故豪鬼成</p><p><em>(1) Isshun sengeki, (2) batsuzan gaisei, (3) kikoku shuushuu, (4) yue ni Goku nari</em></p><p>On a surface level, you could translate it as,</p><p><em>(1) Delivering a thousand strikes in an instant,</em></p><p><em>(2) I uproot mountains and overshadow worlds,</em></p><p><em>(3) Making ghosts constantly cry and wail,</em></p><p><em>(4) Therefore I am Gouki</em></p><p>The official dub renders it as:</p><p><em>(1) Die a thousand deaths</em></p><p><em>(2) Usurp the heavens</em></p><p><em>(3) Embrace the sorrow</em></p><p><em>(4) Become the demon</em></p><p>Already now, I am sure that you’ll see that there are differences between the initial direct translation and the localisation by Capcom’s English team.</p><p>Therefore, treating each of these lines – verses of poetry, if you will – individually, to show how they are references to Classical Chinese literature as well as Gouki’s appearance in the official SF3 manga by Masahiko Nakahira.</p><p>Before moving in, it’s worth noting that each of the 4 lines are composed of 4 kanji and as such initially look great, but whereas the first three are purely read via the Chinese-inspired <em>on-yomi</em>reading, the last is read in the Japanese-inspired <em>kun-yomi</em>reading, and as such breaks the flow/rhythm/structure of the poem itself – the last one is more specifically <em>kun-doku</em>, i.e. translating Classical Chinese into Classical Japanese, as will be explained when we reach the fourth line.</p><p>I will include the literal translation for each line aside it in the title.</p><p><strong>1. 一瞬千撃, lit. one-instant-thousand-strike(s)</strong></p><p>“A thousand strikes in one instant” stems from the SF4 iteration of his Shungokusatsu, where said kanji appear as he strikes a <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nio_(Buddhism)">niou</a> </em>pose signifying the literal nature of the attack hitting numerous times in a flash. This could in turn stem all the way back to the SF3 manga.</p><p>The Niou themselves being fierce guardian dieties, whose very appearance Gouki himself closely resembles right down to posing and physical features.</p><p>Translating it as “die a thousand deaths”, whilst dramatic and certainly fitting Gouki’s overall personality, feels like an exaggeration of the “thousand strike” that he will deliver.</p><p><strong>2. 抜山蓋世, lit. pull-mountain(s)-cover-world(s)</strong></p><p>This line derives from 史記・項羽本紀 (Shi Jie: Book of Xian Yu):</p><p><a href="https://ctext.org/shiji/xiang-yu-ben-ji/zh">力拔山兮氣蓋世，時不利兮騅不逝。騅不逝兮可柰何，虞兮虞兮柰若何！</a></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiang_Yu">Xian Yu</a>, a king of Western Chu, is trapped by Liu Bei’s forces and composes this song.</p><p>In Burton Watson’s translation:</p><p><em>My strength plucked up the hills,/My might shadowed the world;/But the times were against me,/And Dapple runs no more;/When Dapple runs no more,/What then can I do?/Ah, Yu, my Yu,/</em></p><p><em>What will your fate be? </em>(Watson, v. 1, p. 45)</p><p>The pertinent passage being:</p><p>力拔山兮氣蓋世</p><p>(Lit. strength-pull-mountain-EMPH, spirit-cover-world)</p><p>Whence the Japanese idiom 抜山蓋世 derives, in its modern meaning of “having herculean strength.”</p><p>The English’s dub, “usurp the heavens”, makes Gouki sound very Luciferian – thus them making a rather direct reference to the meaning of Akuma, his English name. Where the original line merely references Gouki highlighting his own superhuman strength and power.</p><p><strong>3. 鬼哭啾啾, lit. ghost-wail-cries.</strong></p><p>Note that “cries” are literally a reduplication of the character for “cry” to create a plural.</p><p>This refers to a line from the Tang-era poem “The Ballad of War Carts” by Du Fu, which refers to a peasant-conscript joining the imperial army and experiencing the battlefield first hand. The last two lines of the poem are:</p><p><a href="http://chugokugo-script.net/kanshi/heishakou.html">新鬼煩冤舊鬼哭</a></p><p><a href="http://chugokugo-script.net/kanshi/heishakou.html">天陰雨濕聲啾啾</a></p><p>“Where new ghosts are troubled by the cries of the old</p><p>The sky is gray, it rains, it’s wet, and all about, the sound of constant wailing”</p><p><a href="https://100tangpoems.wordpress.com/2020/01/19/the-ballad-of-war-carts-%E5%85%B5%E8%BB%8A%E8%A1%8C-du-fu/">(translation by Traditionshome, ll. 33 – 34)</a></p><p>Hence abbreviating the entire last phrase into “the constant wailing of crying ghosts.”</p><p>The Japanese idiom, 鬼哭啾啾 can therefore mean "something spine-chilling."</p><p>“Embrace the sorrows” sounds off point, where the original tactfully refers to the 鬼 (oni/ghost) part of his own name, lit. “mighty oni”.</p><p><strong>4. 故豪鬼成, lit. therefore-Gouki-be.</strong></p><p>The line, when spoken by Gouki himself, is: <em>Yue ni Gouki nari</em>, “therefore I am Gouki”, whilst this scans as archaic Japanese, this is in truth somewhat clumsy. It looks great, because it goes 4-4-4-4, but upon reading this out it looks inelegant. Four of the lines are read like Classical Chinese poetry ala <em>on-doku </em>(“sound reading”, i.e. reading as a Middle Chinese text), and the last line <em>“yue ni Gouki nari</em>” is <em>kun-doku</em> (“semantic reading”, i.e. in Japanese, as mentioned previosuly), hence, 故豪鬼成 ought to have been rendered as 故に豪鬼なり with <em>okurigana </em>(grammatical kana) – but is rendered in the former manner to fit in with the previously established pattern. Furthermore, <em>nari </em>(to be) is usually rendered in kanji as 也 rather than 成, which is typically reserved for the meaning “to become”, thus the meaning becomes akin to “therefore, I <em>have</em> <em>become </em>Gouki”, rather than “therefore, I <em>am</em> Gouki.”</p><p>The English version's instance on "become the demon" utterly skips Gouki's literal raison d'etre and makes it sound as if he wants Ryu or whoever he is fighting to recite this as some manner of oath.</p><p><strong>The manga:</strong></p><p>The manga itself is where the four lined poem originally, is, as mentioned, Masahiko Nakahira's brilliant Street Fighter III: Ryu Final, that along side charting the events of the third game also concludes Ryu's narrative with him facing off against the man who slew his master and also became somewhat a opponent-teacher figure for him.</p><p>When the two then eventually face off in the very last volume of the manga, Gouki recites the poem, with the kanji appearing alongside him albeit with no <em>furigana </em>(kana to denote the pronunciation of the characters), hence creating the impression of the last line also being read akin to Classical Chinese.</p><p><strong>In conclusion:</strong></p><p>Gouki as a character is pretty much the warrior-poet despite his spartan exterior and training regiment. Dictated by his own extremely tough code of honour. The four lines essentially refer to Classical Chinese poetry and thus delineate his own way of life - not some strange oath to be sworn by him or his opponent, mid-fight.</p><p>Capcom has otherwise done a superb job at conveying his personality, but have turned the four line poem into less of his personal credo and more a menacing oath for the opposing player to swear by. </p><p>Matching the voice with the mouth flap, and owing to the concise nature of Japanese versus that of English does present a reason why some of these lines are localised as they are, but overall this rendition misses the mark of some of them, whilst keeping his archaic diction intact.</p>

Then, there will be ample to feast upon for him!"</p><p>苦つ膽 here is an obscure term originating in traditional Chinese medicine, literally meaning "bitter liver/innards", but can also refer to bitterness, agony or pain in general - this being the proverbial "peace of mind" that Scrooge can feast upon. She is also notably more polite in this version, using <em>oyobimousu </em>"to humbly summon", and <em>meshiagaru</em> "the gentleman/madam drinks/eats". Hence she increases the politeness to an extreme degree if just to mock Scrooge being the "Founder of the Feast."</p>

PROV ‘as I stand’ (KK 2), spoken by the god Yachihoko no kami no mikoto. This is referred to as ‘absolute [as opposed to relative] respect’ and disappeared in the transition to EMJ. Exaltation is ubiquitous in the literary prose texts from EMJ and early LMJ.</blockquote><p>That is, we generally see in modern Japanese there being polite registers for elevating the object of speech, i.e. the one spoken to or referred to, or anything that is part of their social circle. The speakers themselves never use language to elevate their own status, it's always lowering it through <em>kenjougo</em> (謙譲語, "humble speech"), since the system of keigo does not mechanically have a built in option to aggrandise the speaker.</p><p>That is you can say,</p><p>わたくしめは社長のお考えを尊敬しております<br><em>Watakushi-me wa shachou no o-kangae o sonkei shite orimasu</em><br>"I, lowly one, humbly respect the opinion of the company president"</p><p>You cannot say with a specific set of specialised verbs or conjugations, at least, something akin to "One as great as I do respect our excellent president's opinion" - using verbs normally used to elevate the object, rather than the subject.</p><p>Doing so would produce the bizarre:</p><p>この俺様は社長のお考えを尊敬しておられるぞ！<br><em>Kono ore-sama wa shachou no okangae o sonkei shite orareru zo!</em></p><p>Where おられる and the like are <strong>only</strong> used about other people than yourself and your own personal, social circle.</p><p>Well, outside of the realm of fiction, where such rules are defenstrated for the sake of entertainment, you can't.</p><p>But you could at one point during the Old Japanese period, as Frellesvig points out in the quote use a mode of <em>absolute respect </em>that only counts for the speaker to exhibit extreme self-confidence or ethos for that matter, fittingly as the speaker in the cited example is a god.</p><p>This mode has since become obsolete over the many centuries that has passed, so your only chance of even being remotely, formally assertive, if also regal, in Japanese language is rather limited, indeed.</p>

  thor of marvel versus capcom 3   thor makes his playable debut 2011, where he sported his ultimate look as well as having his classical lee-kirby look as an alternate costume. in the original comics stan lee gave the odinson a shakespearean manner of speaking, which pretty much every single character that had the faintest smell of mythology did. therefore, the japanese translation of his mannerisms, even in the comics, was to give him a regal tone.  take one of his generic victory messages:  余は雷神ソー！主神オーディンの息子にしてアスガード最強の戦士なり！  yo wa raijin sô! shushin ôdin no musuko ni shite asgâdo saikyou no senshi nari!  &quot;i am thor, the god of thunder! son of the chief god, odin, and thereto the strongest warrior there be!&quot;  余 (yo) is a pronoun of ancient stock going as far as back as classical chinese and has been used in japan as a literary pronoun, especially in written correspondence - it has in modern times gained the nuance of how a regal person refers to themselves, thus thor being the crown prince of asgard, he uses this. note that he also uses なり (nari) the classical japanese way of ending your sentences. positively medieval.  another one, with him winning over captain america:  今も昔も貴殿に最大の敬意を払ってきた。だがあなたもただの人でしかないのだ、キャプテン。  ima mo mukashi mo kiden ni saidai no keii wo haratte kita. daga anata mo tada no hito de shika nai no da, kyaputen.  &quot;now as well as yore, ye, sir, ha'n my utmost respect. however ye too are like all others, merely a human.  here things get tricky, he uses 貴殿 (kiden, lit. &quot;honourable hall&quot;), which like 余 above was used in written communication as a polite second person pronominal noun, but is also used in fantasy as a more courteous reference to the interlocutor. he does switch over to あなた (anata), the standard polite pronominal in japanese, which seems strange, going from an archaic and regal tone to an outright polite if uncharacteristically modern one. i use &quot;ye&quot; here as the archaic english second person singular polite pronoun to represent the likes of 貴殿 and also あなた to an extent.   thor of record of ragnarok:   this thor is reticent, carries a hammer the size of a car and speaks mostly through his thunderous strikes. like thor from before, he is of a graceful physical build, but has the red hair of his mythological inspiration. his total amount of lines within the series thus far has been rather sparse, but without further ado, let us take one of his  longer  sentences, said to his opponent lu bü - as part of the grand ragnarok gladiatorial games to decide the fate of humanity:  貴様, 人間なんぞにしておくには勿体ないな  kisama, ningen nanzo ni shite oku ni wa mottai nai na.  &quot;it is such a waste, that you are a naught, but a mortal, bastard.&quot;  rough, manly and to the point with 貴様  (kisama) communicating a soliderly attitude to his opponent.  and another one from the same fight, after having given his opponent the coup de grace:  よかろう… あの漢への… 呂布奉先, 我が友, への手向けだ  yokarou... an otoko e no ... ryofu housen, waga tomo, e no temuke da  &quot;very well... this is my parting gift to that man amongst men, to lu bü, my friend...&quot;  here we get more of an archaic flavour with  yokarou  (it is well) and  waga tomo  (my friend), using the archaic possessive mode of  ware , itself the old japanese pronoun, though thor appears to also use 俺 (ore) elsewhere, the generic assertive male pronominal noun.  thus, the silent if generic warrior with a code of conduct.   thor of god of war: ragnarök   last we get to the iteration rather unflatteringly described by the rather literal godhead mimir, &quot;fat dobber&quot; of the thunderer. who despite said description is a rather realistic portrayal of not just a herculean body builder, but also the god of the original myths. red haired, bearded, bellicose, mead-happy and above all else a force to be reckoned with - literally having thumped the midgard serpent across space and time by virtue of raw power.  in the original english version, this thor is not beyond, rather he relishes, throwing anglo-saxon swears about, abounding in &quot;shits&quot; and &quot;fucks&quot;, rather well rhetorically well placed ones to emphasise his anger or point.  at one point thor threatens atreus, the son of kratos:  うぬはわしがこの手で叩き直してやるわ　ヨトゥン  unu wa washi ga kono te de tatakinaoshite yaru wa yotûn  &quot;thou'lt beat">

His total amount of lines within the series thus far has been rather sparse, but without further ado, let us take one of his <em>longer </em>sentences, said to his opponent Lu Bü - as part of the grand Ragnarok gladiatorial games to decide the fate of humanity:</p><p>貴様, 人間なんぞにしておくには勿体ないな<br><em>Kisama, ningen nanzo ni shite oku ni wa mottai nai na.</em><br>"It is such a waste, that you are a naught, but a mortal, bastard."</p><p>Rough, manly and to the point with 貴様  (kisama) communicating a soliderly attitude to his opponent.</p><p>And another one from the same fight, after having given his opponent the coup de grace:</p><p>よかろう… あの漢への… 呂布奉先, 我が友, への手向けだ<br><em>Yokarou...

Who despite said description is a rather realistic portrayal of not just a herculean body builder, but also the god of the original myths. Red haired, bearded, bellicose, mead-happy and above all else a force to be reckoned with - literally having thumped the Midgard Serpent across space and time by virtue of raw power.</p><p>In the original English version, this Thor is not beyond, rather he relishes, throwing Anglo-Saxon swears about, abounding in "shits" and "fucks", rather well rhetorically well placed ones to emphasise his anger or point.</p><p>At one point Thor threatens Atreus, the son of Kratos:</p><p>うぬはわしがこの手で叩き直してやるわ　ヨトゥン<br><em>Unu wa washi ga kono te de tatakinaoshite yaru wa Yotûn</em><br>"Thou'lt beaten into shape by my very own hand, churlish Jotun!"</p><p>And, during one of the confrontations against Kratos, he has this piece of existential advice to his fellow fighting-happy god:</p><p>わしらは決して変わらん。わしらは一生破壊者のままよ<br><em>Washira wa kesshite kawaran. Washira wa isshou hakaisha no mama yo.</em><br>"We cannot change, no matter what. We shall remain damn destroyers for life!"</p><p>You will have noticed, if you know a bit of Japanese or follow my ramblings online, that he uses <em>washi, </em>originally a dialectal pronominal, but later becoming a solid part of how elderly speak in pop-culture, hence Thor sounds like a worn-down god of thunder, having seen better days - fitting with his alcoholism as well. He uses <em>unu, </em>quite an archaic pronominal that whilst literally meaning "thou" or "oneself", has the impact of "cur", "churl" or even "fucker", hence Thor is rather vulgar if archaically mouthed in the Japanese version.</p><p>Returning to his usage of elderly speech:</p><p>よそ者のうぬは"血の償い"の掟を知らんじゃろうがのお<br><em>Yosomono no unu wa "chi no tsugunai" no okite wo shiran jarou ga noo</em><br>"Methinketh that outsiders like thyself know not of the law of 'debt of blood', truly."</p><p>Not only do we have <em>ja, </em>the copula, i.e. "to be, it is", but also <em>noo, </em>a variant of <em>nou</em>, a rather old fashioned and elderly way of creating emphasis akin to <em>na </em>and <em>ne </em>in modern Japanese.</p><p>He sounds a lot olderly than he is, and his father Odin also uses <em>washi</em>, but combines it with a lot more formal speech patterns.</p><p>I will return to the speech patterns of the cast of God of War at some point, since there is more to this adaptation in the Japanese version.</p><p><strong>In conclusion:</strong></p><p>Marvel's is overly theatrical, Record's is quite reticent and God of War's is closer to the original source, but a broken one that tries to come to terms with his past.</p>

I don’t care whether or not you are gonna help me, I will absolutely track it down!” </em>(English translation is my own)</p><p><em>Boku </em>is used here by him prior to his training with Mishima and <em>anta </em>underlines a less polite variation of <em>anata</em>, showing his frustration towards his paternal grandfather – having not shown much hospitality when Jin has barely survived against from the monster, and his mother sacrificed herself to blow it up.</p><p>Elsewhere <em>boku </em>resurfaces when he talks to an old friend of his. <em>Ore </em>is otherwise his main go to pronoun in terms of projecting the more mature/hardened persona of his.</p>

                    <p>In Elden Ring, one of the bosses that you can encounter is a ogreish warrior known as Margit the Fell Omen, which in Japanese corresponds to: 忌み鬼マルギット (Imi Oni Marugitto, "Shunned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oni">Oni</a><em> </em>Margit").</p><p>Oni here doesn't literally refer to the mythical creature itself, but moreover to the idea of Margit being shunned because of his monstrous appearance. "Fell" reappears throughout Elden Ring as a consistent localisation choice for 忌み (imi, "shunned, prohibited, taboo"), derived from the verb 忌む (imu, "to detest"). Related is also the adjective 忌々しい (imaimashii, "provoking, annoying"). All in all this suggests that Margit was not just unwanted, but thoroughly reviled because of his horned looks - which bode ill in the mythology of the game.</p><p>Fell in English is an archaic word meaning "ruthless, savage" (derived from Middle English <em>fell </em>("angry, fierce"), and in general describes something monstrous or ill-boding:</p><p><em>But my heart forbodes that, ere all is ended, you, Frodo son of Drogo, will know more of these fell things than Gildor Inglorion.</em><br>(Lord of the Rings - Fellowship of the Ring, Tolkien)</p><p>"Fell things" here referring to the hordes of Mordor, warped and cursed beings that all serve the eponymous Lord of the Rings, Sauron.</p>

            <article id="lord-of-dragons" class="gh-post" data-search-content="    spoilers are aplenty     we shall be looking into perhaps one of the most enigmatic characters of elden ring.  before proceeding know that this article delves into possibly one of the most impressive secrets of the game.  popular youtuber and expert on elden ring information as well as data, zullie the witch, posted  a video  recently covering an important discovery in regards to placidusax, one of the game's optional if last bosses.  she remarked that his title and weapon, a tail-formed sword that the player gets from retrieving the &quot;memory&quot;, i.e. reward, from said dragon and exchanging it, could refer to the old tradition in from's games of having the player chop off the tail of a dragon and receive a sword or weapon from them.  furthermore, the name of both placidusax and that of a weapon of a dark souls 1 boss, the gaping dragon's dragon king greataxe would hint at an homage linking these two and the tradition.  we will be looking at the flavour text from three items appertaining to placidusax in the game, the &quot;dragon king cragblade&quot;, &quot;placidusax's ( sic ) ruin&quot; and &quot;remembrance of the dragon king.&quot;  prior to beginning a small note on the name of the dragon himself, in japanese script it is written プラキドサクス,  purakidosakusu,  i.e. implying that the name is pronounced as classical latin, rather than having the &quot;c&quot; as an /s/, but as a /k/, therefore it's &quot;pla-kee-do-sax&quot; and  not  &quot;pla-see-do-sax.&quot; his name consists of two parts: latin   placidus   meaning &quot;calm, still, peaceful, gentle, placid&quot;, especially the senses of &quot;still&quot;, &quot;calm&quot; and &quot;placid&quot; are apt due to his dormant nature most of the game, only slowly waking up to fight the player once they enter his mausolaeum;   saxum  , the second part, literally means &quot;rock, stone&quot; referring to his body's literal petrified state. hence, this suffix &quot;-sax&quot; repeats itself in the names of other boss dragons - hearkening back to that age. minerals, rocks, crystals, alchemy and so on figure strongly and symbolically in elden ring.   dragon king's cragblade (竜王の岩剣,  ryuu'ou no ganken,  dragon king's boulder/rock sword):   the description is as follows in the official english version:   piercing gravel stone sword containing primeval lightning. a portion of the dragonlord's power, gained from a remembrance.    this weapon commands great power over the paltry, mortal dragons of today.   and the original japanese version:  原初の雷を宿したさざれ石の刺剣 追憶から得られた、竜王の力の片鱗 永遠なき、卑小な竜の末裔たちに高い威力を発揮する   gensho no kaminari o yadoshita sazareishi no shiken. tsuioku kara erareta, ryuu'ou no chikara no henrin.   eien naki, hishou na ryuu no matsuei-tachi ni takai iryoku o hakki-suru.   &quot;stabbing-sword of gravel containing primordial lightning. a portion being granted from the remembrance of the dragon king. this displays the great might of the evanescent and trifling descendants of the dragons.&quot;  following things worth noting: 1) the japanese description directly mentions that this power belongs to the  &quot;trifling descendants of the dragons&quot; (卑小な竜の末裔たち) , thus directly stating that the numerous dragons, two-winged and four-winged that dot the land of elden ring are the descendant of much older and more powerful dragons akin to the four-headed placidusax. 2) they are directly described as &quot; evanescent &quot; i.e. not lasting forever, where the literal japanese wording is 永遠なき (eien-naki, &quot;forever-not&quot;), in relation to placidusax's temporal suspention and immortality. 3) the sword contains &quot;promordial lightning&quot; (原初の雷), litreally &quot;the first lightning&quot;, but &quot;primeval&quot; and &quot;primordial&quot; both refer to the same sense of &quot;of the beginning,&quot; &quot;original&quot; and &quot;the first.&quot;  overall the english localisation did a great job at conveying the basic nuances of the japanese text, but skipping the sense of them being &quot;descendants&quot; unfortunately means a nice detail is lost in regards to how much more fearsome placidusax is to his offspring.   placidusax's ( sic ) ruin (プラキドサクスの滅び,  purakidosakusu no horobi,  &quot;placidusax' destruction&quot;)   official english flavour text:   power gleaned form the remembrance of dragonlord placidusax. transforms caster into the dragonlord to spew golden breath from above. this incantation can be cast while jumping. these are the dying wails of the dragonlord who once dwelled eternal beyond time.   japanese original:  竜王プラキドサクスの追憶から得られた力 己が姿を竜王となし、上空から金色のブレスを吐く ジャンプ中に使うこともできる それは、時の狭間に永遠に座した竜王の滅びゆく断末魔であった   ryuu'ou purakidosakusu no tsuioku kara erareta chikara   onoga sugata o ryuu'ou to nashi, juukuu kara ougon no buresu o tsuku   janpu-chuu ni tsukau koto mo dekiru   sore wa, toki no hazama ni eien ni zashita ryuu'ou no horobi yuku danmatsuma de atta.   &quot;power attained from the remembrance of placidusax, the dragon king. one’s own form becomes that of the dragon king, spewing a golden breath from mid-air. this is also useable whilst jumping. these were the death throes of the dragon king facing destruction sitting eternally at the interstice of time.&quot;

This is also useable whilst jumping.<br>These were the death throes of the Dragon King facing destruction sitting eternally at the interstice of time."</p><p>"A few things of interest:<br>1) His literal title in Japanese is 竜王 (ryuu'ou, "dragon king"), not "lord" as in the English localisation, which has had history with the other Soulsborne games of translating 王 as "lord" rather than "king."<br>2) The last paragraph needs some glossing:<br><strong>Interstice of time (時の狭間) - </strong>Here literally could also be translated as "temporal interstice" or "temporal space (between)", it is in fact <em>hazama </em>(interstice) that is the term that otherwise is consistenly translated as the "Land Between" in Elden Ring, but is otherwise a regular word in Japanese referring to an interval, interstice or a space between something. Here it means that Placidusax is sitting in a very literal crevice in time, since he is himself a being from another period.<br><strong>Death throes (断末魔) </strong>-  represent in English the expression 断末魔 (dansatsuma, "death throes, hours of death, agony of dath"), whilst literally meaning "judgement-end-demon" <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%96%AD%E6%9C%AB%E9%AD%94">it derives from Buddhism.</a><br><strong>Facing destruction (滅びゆく) - </strong>This is technically the verb <em>horobu</em> (to destroy, to perish, to (fall into) ruin) plus an auxiliary verb that denotes the indicative, i.e. "being destroyed", "facing destruction"). In other words Placidusax appears to be temporally suspended, moribund and as can be seen from his grotesquely scarred body is hardly at the height of his actual power - the player delivering the coup de grace to a dying king of the dragons.<br><strong>Were (であった) - </strong>May seem like a pointless thing to highlight, but in Japanese the existential copula (i.e. "to be") goes at the end of the sentence, in other words since this is placed in the past tense it all the more heightens Placidusax' role as a primeval creature.</p><p><strong>Rembrance of the Dragonlord (竜王の追憶, <em>Ryuu'ou no tsuioku, </em>"Remembrance of the Dragon King")</strong></p><p>Official English:</p><p>Remembrance of Dragonlord Placidusax, hewn into the Erdtree.<br>The power of its namesake can be unlocked by the Finger Reader. Alternatively, it can be used to gain a great bounty of runes.<br>The Dragonlord whose seat lies at the heart of the storm beyond time is said to have been Elden Lord in the age before the Erdtree. Once his god was fled, the lord continued to await its return.<br><br>Original Japanese:</p><p>黄金樹に刻まれた竜王プラキドサクスの追憶<br>指読みにより、主の力を得ることができる<br>また、使用により莫大なルーンを得ることもできる<br>時の狭間、嵐の中心に座す竜王は<br>黄金樹の前史、エルデの王であったという<br>だが神は去り、王は帰還を待ち続けていた</p><p><em>Ougonju ni kizamareta ryuu'ou purakidosakusu no tsuioki. Yubiyomi ni yori, nushi no chikara o eru koto ga dekiru. Mata, shiyou ni yori bakudai na ruun o eru koto mo dekiru.</em><br><em>Toki no hazama, arashi no chuushin ni zasu ryuu'ou wa ougonju no zenreki, erude no ou deatta to iu daga kami wa sari, ou wa kikan o machitsudukete ita.</em></p><p>"Remembrance of the Dragon King, Placidusax, carved into the Golden Tree. It is possible to get the power of its owner from the Finger Reader, it is also possible to gain an exceptional amount of ruins.<br>The Dragon King sitting in the eye of the storm in the temporal interstice, was called an Elden King in the prehistory of the Golden Tree. The god(s) however vanished and thus the King continue to await their homecoming."</p><p>Other than slight rephrasings and wordings it is very much the same, apart from the fact that "Erd Tree" is in the original 黄金樹 (<em>ougonju, </em>"Golden Tree" or "Gold Tree"), fitting with the name of the Golden Order (黄金律, <em>ougonritsu, </em>"Law/Order of Gold"). Elden Lord once more uses 王 (<em>ou, </em>"king") as "lord", but the term has historically been gender-neutral, so one could argue that "Elden Ruler" would convey the sense better.</p><p><strong><u>The Comparison between the Gaping Dragon and Placidusax:</u></strong></p><p>Last, but not least, addressing the question in the beginning, in regards to the titles of the Gaping Dragon, in the flavour text of his axe, and that of Placidusax. The weapon is in the English localisation "Dragon King Greataxe" and in the original Japanese version 竜王の大斧, (<em>Ryuu'ou no daifu, </em>"Great Axe of the Dragon King"), which plainly demonstrates that they both have the same epithet.</p>

This does figure into the game’s story of the player becoming the Elden Lord, where he will finally if the progress of the story permits it call them “my Lord,” which reflects the original’s わが王 (<em>waga ou</em>, “my king”).</p><p>If we look at one of his later lines that reflect this meek diction in action,</p><p>お願いです、ご主人さま<br>お針子として、貴方にお仕えさせてください<br><br><em>Onegai desu, goshujinsama</em><br><em>Ohariko toshite anata ni otsukaete kudasai</em><br><br>“I have a wish, Master."<br>"Could You please consider me serving You as Your seamer, Worship?”</p><p>Here his language is completely humble, in the register of <em>kenjougo </em>(“humble language”), replete with the auxiliary request verb <em>kudasaru </em>in the honorific mode of <em>otsukaete kudasai , </em>“Could (I) please serve (you)”, lit. the honorific お (o) + 仕える (tsukaeru, to serve) + 下さる (kudasaru, “to deign to grant”) – thus reflecting his respect towards the player, even if extreme. He still doesn’t stop from using <em>oira </em>in his polite dialogue, though he does also use <em>bokku me, </em>ボックめ (“I, humble Boc”):</p><p>ああでも、それでも、できるだけボックめにお申し付けください<br><em>Aa demo, soredemo, dekiru dake bokku me ni omoushitsuke kudasai</em><br>Oh, but please permit humble Boc to do whatever he can in his power”</p><p>And,</p><p>こんな醜いオイラを、それでも、美しいと言ってくださるのですか？<br><em>Konna minikui oira o, soredemo utskushii to itte kudasaru no desu ka?</em><br>“Even then, fer ugly me t’ be called ‘beautiful’ by You, Master”</p><p>As well as him also referring to his mother with the honorific <em>kaa-sama </em>(母さま)<em>, </em>really renders him an a times utterly despairing character, whose lot in life is greatly rendered fortunate by the player themself showing the mercy and attention to Boc by allowing him to become their personal seamer, whereby the player then can modify their armour.</p><p>His final fate however of wanting to become beautiful is left for the player to decide.</p>

            <article id="elden-ring-spoilers-name-allusions" class="gh-post" data-search-content=" from software has a tradition of putting especial significance in their world building when it comes to structuring their role playing games, moreover, the latest instalment, elden ring only proves this.   spoilers are below, do not proceed with reading if you have not played the game, or care for story details!   i will in this very brief article delineate the most prominent traits in the nomenclature of the game and especially how it related to tolkien's own naming schemes.   a dynasty of prefixes   j. r. r. tolkien, when naming the kings of gondor, would do so by virtue of alliteration, that is aragorn and his lineage would have the prefix  ara- , appearing throughout most of the names of his forefathers, the element itself literally meaning &quot;king&quot; or &quot;royal.&quot; this was chiefest in importance, the meaning of the suffix was second. thus, starting with aragorn, arathorn, aranarth, arahael, aranuir, aravir, araglas, arahad, aragost aravorn and so on, excluding any duplicates. likewise the names of the kings and queens of elden ring's universe use recurring prefixes. such as radahn being the son of radagon.  the tradition of carrying over a nominal element is ancient and we see this across the world. in anglo saxon royal families it was custom for sons or daughters to inherit a prefix from their parents or ancestors, thus the element  æðel  (&quot;noble&quot;) appears in the names of mercian monarchs such as  æðelstān  (&quot;noble stone&quot;),  æðelred  (&quot;noble counsel&quot;),  æðelbald  (&quot;noble bold&quot;) and so on, where the literal meaning of the name, as seen in the former, was not as important as the heritage of preserving this familial prefix.  godfrey's lineage which features the son's godwyn and godrick, features the element  god,  literally corresponding to its modern english homophone, playing on the crucial role that the demi-gods have in the world of elden ring. furthermore, the literal meanings of the suffixes suggest the personality differences between the brothers, and their relations:  godfrey (of  godefroy,  cognate with oe,  godfriþ,  &quot;god peace&quot;) - being the first elden lord, siring a line. his reign presumably being set before the chaos that was to follow gives his name weight. godwyn (oe,  godwine  &quot;god friend&quot;) - implying his benevolent disposition as a ruler. godrick (oe,  godric,  &quot;god ruler&quot;) - his domineering personality contrasted to godwyn.  furthermore, godfrey could be a reference to  geoffrey of monmouth , a famous writer and mediaeval historian, whose pseudo-historical work   history of the kings of britain  , would lay the foundations for modern arthurian myths, a source which has been drawn upon numerous times in from's  other works , even featuring a character named artorias, derived from the latin  artorius , one of the proposed  etymon  for the modern name arthur.  the other sons of godfrey: the twins  morgot  and  mohg , have names that sound less like they were derived from old english or old french, but the mythos of tolkien, it being the name of  a malevolent spiri t, and said spirit would go on to rule over sauron, one of the lords of the rings - whence much of elden ring's universe gives homage, even if the element  got  could be construed to be derived from  god. mohg  could be an echo of   gothmog .   one of the other prominent dynasties of demi-gods in elden ring, is that of radagon, whose son radahn inherits the first two syllables, as well as his daugher, ranni inheriting the first syllable. likewise with marika, malaketh and malenia.   of moons, fauns and elvish   ranni in particular, along with her mother, rennala, have especial relevance in terms of naming and relevance to the plot. both carry lunar epithets, and ranni's name could possibly be derived from the sindarin word   rana   (&quot;moon&quot;), derived from the element  ran  (&quot;to wander&quot;), relating also to her vagrant nature. her mother is known as not just the queen of the full moon, 満月の女王 ( mangetsu no joou,  &quot;queen of the full moon&quot;) in the japanese script, where  renna-  is presumably derived from  rana , but it also sounds akin to the latin  renatus  (&quot;to rebirth&quot;), owing to her reputation and ability to resurrect the player - more practically giving the player the ability to re-roll their character's stats.  she herself even states in the very opening to the boss fight:  ああ、貴方… きっと良い子に産んであげるわ…  aa, anata... kitto yoiko ni undeageru wa...  &quot;oh, surely, my dear, shall i birth you as a good child&quot;  corresponding to the english version's:  hush, little  culver . i'll soon birth thee anew, a  sweeting  fresh and pure...   thus her theme as a lunar queen and goddess of rebirth is accentuated in the script and naming, too. her design also takes a few hints from  onmyoji  and the cone-hatted  sandman , dreams also being a strong recurring theme in their games such as bloodborne. though fitting the moon theme it may also take some cues from the fairy-tale character of  kaguya.    marika's  role as the divine mother and begetter of the hous">

R. R. Tolkien, when naming the kings of Gondor, would do so by virtue of alliteration, that is Aragorn and his lineage would have the prefix <em>ara-</em>, appearing throughout most of the names of his forefathers, the element itself literally meaning "king" or "royal." This was chiefest in importance, the meaning of the suffix was second. Thus, starting with Aragorn, Arathorn, Aranarth, Arahael, Aranuir, Aravir, Araglas, Arahad, Aragost Aravorn and so on, excluding any duplicates. Likewise the names of the kings and queens of Elden Ring's universe use recurring prefixes. Such as Radahn being the son of Radagon.</p><p>The tradition of carrying over a nominal element is ancient and we see this across the world. In Anglo Saxon royal families it was custom for sons or daughters to inherit a prefix from their parents or ancestors, thus the element <em>æðel </em>("noble") appears in the names of Mercian monarchs such as <em>Æðelstān </em>("noble stone"), <em>Æðelred </em>("noble counsel"), <em>Æðelbald </em>("noble bold") and so on, where the literal meaning of the name, as seen in the former, was not as important as the heritage of preserving this familial prefix.</p><p>Godfrey's lineage which features the son's Godwyn and Godrick, features the element <em>god, </em>literally corresponding to its modern English homophone, playing on the crucial role that the demi-gods have in the world of Elden Ring. Furthermore, the literal meanings of the suffixes suggest the personality differences between the brothers, and their relations:</p><p>Godfrey (OF <em>Godefroy, </em>cognate with OE, <em>Godfriþ, </em>"god peace") - Being the first Elden Lord, siring a line. His reign presumably being set before the chaos that was to follow gives his name weight.<br>Godwyn (OE, <em>Godwine </em>"god friend") - Implying his benevolent disposition as a ruler.<br>Godrick (OE, <em>Godric, </em>"god ruler") - His domineering personality contrasted to Godwyn.</p><p>Furthermore, Godfrey could be a reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_of_Monmouth">Geoffrey of Monmouth</a>, a famous writer and mediaeval historian, whose pseudo-historical work <em><a href="https://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/eng/gem/index.htm">History of the Kings of Britain</a></em>, would lay the foundations for modern Arthurian myths, a source which has been drawn upon numerous times in From's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Souls">other works</a>, even featuring a character named Artorias, derived from the Latin <a href="http://www.heroicage.org/issues/1/halac.htm">Artorius</a>, one of the proposed <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/etymon#Noun">etymon</a> for the modern name Arthur.</p><p>The other sons of Godfrey: the twins <em>Morgot </em>and <em>Mohg</em>, have names that sound less like they were derived from Old English or Old French, but the mythos of Tolkien, it being the name of <a href="http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Morgoth">a malevolent spiri</a>t, and said spirit would go on to rule over Sauron, one of the Lords of the Rings - whence much of Elden Ring's universe gives homage, even if the element <em>got </em>could be construed to be derived from <em>god. Mohg </em>could be an echo of <em><a href="http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Gothmog_(Lieutenant_of_Morgul)">Gothmog</a>.</em></p><p>One of the other prominent dynasties of demi-gods in Elden Ring, is that of Radagon, whose son Radahn inherits the first two syllables, as well as his daugher, Ranni inheriting the first syllable. Likewise with Marika, Malaketh and Malenia.</p><p><strong>Of Moons, Fauns and Elvish</strong></p><p>Ranni in particular, along with her mother, Rennala, have especial relevance in terms of naming and relevance to the plot. Both carry lunar epithets, and Ranni's name could possibly be derived from the Sindarin word <em><a href="https://www.elfdict.com/w/rana">Rana</a> </em>("moon"), derived from the element <em>ran </em>("to wander"), relating also to her vagrant nature. Her mother is known as not just the Queen of the Full Moon, 満月の女王 (<em>Mangetsu no Joou, </em>"Queen of the Full Moon") in the Japanese script, where <em>Renna- </em>is presumably derived from <em>Rana</em>, but it also sounds akin to the Latin <em>renatus </em>("to rebirth"), owing to her reputation and ability to resurrect the player - more practically giving the player the ability to re-roll their character's stats. <br>She herself even states in the very opening to the boss fight:</p><p>ああ、貴方…<br>きっと良い子に産んであげるわ…<br><em>Aa, anata... kitto yoiko ni undeageru wa...</em><br>"Oh, surely, my dear, shall I birth you as a good child"</p><p>Corresponding to the English version's:<br><em>Hush, little <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/culver#Noun">culver</a>. I'll soon birth thee anew, a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sweeting#Noun">sweeting</a> fresh and pure...</em></p><p>Thus her theme as a lunar queen and goddess of rebirth is accentuated in the script and naming, too. Her design also takes a few hints from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onmy%C5%8Dji">Onmyoji</a> and the cone-hatted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandman">Sandman</a>, dreams also being a strong recurring theme in their games such as Bloodborne. Though fitting the moon theme it may also take some cues from the fairy-tale character of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_the_Bamboo_Cutter">Kaguya.</a></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marica_(mythology)">Marika's</a> role as the divine mother and begetter of the houses of demi-gods can also be seen as fitting into the larger theme of rebirth. In Roman mythology Marica was a nymph and the mother of the god <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faunus">Faunus</a>, he was revered as a god of fertility, nature, the countryside and above all else appearing as the god Inuus, when inducing fertility to cattle - in other words a god whose attributes were closely tied to birth, and also to nature, whereof the Erdtree, the pivotal Yggdrasil of the game, is not just a nexus of souls, but also a cosmic symbol of nature within the game.</p><p>From's video game director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidetaka_Miyazaki">Hidetaka Miyazaki</a> has also <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-was-influenced-by-lord-of-the-rings-and-the-eternal-champion-godfrey-character-explained/">admitted</a> that he is a huge admirer of the works of Tolkien, so the influence in terms of the Elven languages of Sindarin and Quenya as well as direct references to characters in the mythos are not random at all.</p><p>Having the help from one of the great fantasy writers of modern times, George R. R. Martin, also helped helped with creating the high fantasy, if also Gothic, framework for the game's setting, even if Miyazaki's role playing games to begin with heavily featured Gothic fantasy elements.</p><p><strong>EDIT:</strong><br>A friend of mine mentioned this <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/all-of-elden-rings-demigods-have-names-fro">article</a> to me, wherein it is very much confirmed that all of the major characters have their names begin with the same initial letters as the initials of George R. R. Martin's name, hence Godrick, Radagon, Radahn, Miqeula and so on.</p>

Somersaults’re impossible!”</p><p>There’s a lot of elongated vowels, he turns his <em>~ai </em>into <em>ee, </em>where are the benchmark of typical masculine speech, when depicting either people who want to come off as tough or “street”; though this is a character whose momentum alone demolishes streets due to his superhuman toughness. His first person pronoun <em>ore-sama </em>is essentially the already assertive masculine <em>ore </em>plus the honorific <em>sama </em>("lord/lady"), thus "my magnificent self," but since this is Juggernaut, it's "I, the fucking/damn/great Juggernaut." He uses the second person pronoun <em>omee, </em>a slurred variation of <em>omae</em>, which in some circumstances can equate to flipping the bird at someone. Rammed his armoured one too many times at the wall, it seems.</p><p><strong>Dhalsim:</strong></p><p>すこしトボケた味のある、ダルシムのセリフ。悟りきっと者のみが知る、心の余裕なのでしょうか。ちなみにこのセリフを書いた企画マンは哲学科出身ですが、煩悩が多いことで知られています。</p><p>“Having the quality of growing a bit senile, that’s Dhalsim’s quotes. Is he a man whose heart has become placid as a result of pursuing the knowledge of enlightenment? By the way, Kikakuman who wrote his quotes, has his origins lies in philosophy, but he is himself one who knows many worldly desires.”</p><p>The Yogi-master of the Street Fighter series is a character whose personality and diction is characterised by semi-archaic phrases and vague advice. He doesn’t quite speak the geriatric sociolect, but rather results to a more elevated speech. </p><p>心に迷いが生じたら、また私のもとに来なさい<br><em>Kokoro ni mayoi ga shoujitara, mata watashi no moto ni kinasai.</em><br>“If there still arises bewildering in thy heart, pray, come back to me at once”</p><p>定めの炎、そなたの悪しき心をやきつくす…<br><em>Sadame no honoo, sonata no ashiki kokoro wo yakitsukusu…</em><br>“The flames of fate shall burn through thy wicked heart…”</p><p>He uses <em>sonata </em>(“thou”), which is a lightly courteous if archaic way to refer to someone, in other games he uses <em>onushi, </em>a more informal pronoun that is more strongly associated with the geriatric sociolect. His pronoun is <em>watashi </em>rather than <em>washi, </em>and combining this with the polite imperative form <em>-nasai</em>, it gives him the aura of an aged teacher, who is scolding with wisdom his still ignorant opponents. "Kikakuman" is one of the members of the Capcom staff who did the quote-writing, but not the commentator themself.</p><p><strong>Gouki:</strong></p><p>だいぶ豪鬼もしゃべるようになってきました。もしかしてにせものなのでしょうか？　でもこのゲームには、真・豪鬼はでませんのであしからず…。</p><p>“Even Gouki seems to have become more talkative. Perhaps he is really a imposter? However, don’t misunderstand me since Shin Gouki does not appear in this game…”</p><p>Verbosity is a rarity for the otherwise laconic Gouki, whose fists do the majority of his persuasion of being the strongest martial artist alive. His lines are borderline Old Japanese, peppered with the kind of avuncular admonishment that you would expect Ryu and Ken to receive from the brother of their foster-father-teacher.</p><p>我が名はゴウキ！　拳を極めし者なり！<br><em>Waga na wa Gouki! Kobushi wo kiwameshi mono nari!</em><br>“My name is Gouki! He who hath mastered the fist!”</p><p>まだわからぬか！　ぬしの力が！<br><em>Mada wakaranu ka! Nushi no chikara ga!</em><br>“Yet thou knowest not, wretch! Thine own power!”</p><p>弱きは恥、己を知らぬは愚なり！<br><em>Yowaki wa haji, onore wo shiranu wa gu nari!</em><br>“To be weak is shameful, to not know thine own self is foolish!”</p><p>Gouki (known in the West as "Akuma"), uses the first person pronoun <em>ware</em>, which is Old Japanese and registered as as extremely archaic, his second person pronoun <em>nushi, </em>is a clipping of the informal archaic pronoun <em>onushi </em>(おぬし), thus giving it an even more insulting tone, hence "wretch" in the translation.</p><p>If Dhalsim was more polite in his manner of teaching his opponents the error of their ways, Gouki very much holds no such punches back and utters it laconically as is, though his quotes are the absolute fewest in the game, 16 or so, but most of these are merely single lines, versus the two that make up most of the characters’, and even then the commentator remarks how unusually loquacious Gouki is in this game – going as far as to say that he may be an impostor. <em>Shin Gouki </em>("True Gouki") is an enhanced version of the character appearing in other games as a final or secret boss if specific conditions were met.</p><p>Bibliography:</p><p>Matsui Yuuichi (ed.) et al, <em>Gamest Mook - X-Men vs Street Fighter - </em>Shinseisha Capcom, 30. 12. 1996.

            <article id="naming-rock-exe-series" class="gh-post" data-search-content=" one of my many interests when it comes to linguistics and especially also literature is that of personal names, when writing a story or a piece of media, the author(s) will some times create names that either are puns, homages or otherwise have significant meanings to either the personalities of the characters, or their role in the plot of the story.  video games are no stranger to the concept of name-puns and have interesting etymologies in terms of what the author intended, the localisation process of games that are rich with a distinct cast.  we see this with the phoenix wright series, where the characters have names that relate to aspects of their roles in the narrative of the series and the individual episodes, likewise in the game boy advance role-playing game series, rock man exe, known as megaman battle network in the west, we see various characters with names routed in computer technology or general references to their being.  the game itself is heavily founded the already internet-embedded information age of the early 00s, and the exe series sees the hero, netto hikari, the young hero of the series, and his digital friend and navigation programme (&quot;internet navigator= netnavi&quot;), rock man, which more or less is the game's excuse to feature digital superheroes fighting off digital villains, whose operators, the game's term for anyone who owns a navigation programme and in turn is its master and helps it during battles. a game very much made in the image of the monster collection craze akin to pokemon, digimon,  monster farmer  and so on that peopled the late 90s to mid-2000s.  capcom already their famous platform game franchise, rock man (also known as mega man in the west), and in decided to use this robotic hero as the model for their new battle-rpg series for nintendo's handheld machines.  proceeding into the analysis of the names themselves, there are going to be obvious   spoilers   in terms of characters, and as such the rest of the article will be about the importance of the names in relation to the grander scope of the narrative of the various games. i apologise if the vastness of the cast can seem overwhelming to the uninitiated.  the names are given in the traditional japanese order of surname first, and the localised names are mentioned in brackets. i will comment on the localised names as well, if there is anything worthy of note in terms of the puns.   hikari family:    hikari netto (&quot;lan hikari&quot;):   光 – “light” 熱斗 - “passionate, heat” + “dipper, battle”  the hero of the game. 熱斗 is homophone with ネット (“computer network”). i noted the meaning “battle” because of how 斗 has been archaically used in the past as a contraction for 闘 (battle,  tou ). the localisation lan literally refers to  lan , a computer network critical to local connections.   hikari saito (&quot;hub hikari&quot;):   光 – “light” 彩斗 - “colouring” + “dipper, battle”  the deceased twin-brother and navigation programme of netto, essentially a posthumous brain-upload given digital form.  彩斗 is homophone with サイト (“website”). &quot;hub&quot; here refers presumably to an  ethernet hub , likewise a critical component for internet reception.   hikari haruka (&quot;haruka hikari&quot;)   光 – “light” はる香 - “ haru ” (phonetic script) + “fragrance”  the mother of the twins. はる is written in hiragana and such has on its own no apparent meaning, but usually is written with kanji such as 春 (“spring season”). her forename is pronounced similar to 遥か (“distant”).   hikari yuuichirou (&quot;yuichiro hikari&quot;)   光 – “light” ゆういちろう - “ yuuichirou”  (phonetic script)  the father of the twins, and also the computer scientist who transformed saito into rock man. the forename is also written in kanji as 一朗, whilst literally “help” + “one” + “cheerful”. i am not sure where the source for this name stems from. perhaps after an employee at capcom?   ijouin family:    ijouin enzan (&quot;eugene chaud&quot;):   伊集院 - “that” + “gather” + “temple” 炎山 - “flame” + “mountain”  the initial rival and then later friend of netto, possessing a cooler mind in comparison to the hot-head, netto. 伊集 is based off the similar sounding 委譲 (“transfer”), 炎山 w. 演算 (“calculation”). his forename can literally be glossed as “mountain of flames,” and as such the connotation of heat/fervour matches that of the 熱 in netto’s name.  eugene  is probably to match phonetically that of  ijouin,  and  chaud  is derived from a french word meaning  hot/warm  in reference to the literal meaning of  enzan.    ijouin shuuseki (&quot;shuseki ijouin&quot;):   伊集院 - “that” + “gather” + “temple” 秀石 - “excellence” + “stone”  秀石 is homphonous to 集積 (“integration”). the wealthy and estranged father of enzan. both his son’s forename and his own can be couple with 回路 (“circuit”,  kairo ) to produce computer-mechanical related words. strangely enough his name is rendered the same as in japanese.   friends of hikari netto and hikari saito:    sakurai meiru (&quot;mayl sakurai&quot;):   桜井 - “cherry blossom” + “well” メイル - “ meiru”  (phonetic script)  the girlfri">

                    <p>One of my many interests when it comes to linguistics and especially also literature is that of personal names, when writing a story or a piece of media, the author(s) will some times create names that either are puns, homages or otherwise have significant meanings to either the personalities of the characters, or their role in the plot of the story.</p><p>Video games are no stranger to the concept of name-puns and have interesting etymologies in terms of what the author intended, the localisation process of games that are rich with a distinct cast.</p><p>We see this with the Phoenix Wright series, where the characters have names that relate to aspects of their roles in the narrative of the series and the individual episodes, likewise in the Game Boy Advance role-playing game series, Rock Man EXE, known as Megaman Battle Network in the West, we see various characters with names routed in computer technology or general references to their being.</p><p>The game itself is heavily founded the already internet-embedded information age of the early 00s, and the EXE series sees the hero, Netto Hikari, the young hero of the series, and his digital friend and navigation programme ("Internet Navigator= NetNavi"), Rock Man, which more or less is the game's excuse to feature digital superheroes fighting off digital villains, whose operators, the game's term for anyone who owns a navigation programme and in turn is its master and helps it during battles. A game very much made in the image of the monster collection craze akin to Pokemon, Digimon, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Rancher">Monster Farmer</a> and so on that peopled the late 90s to mid-2000s.</p><p>Capcom already their famous platform game franchise, Rock Man (also known as Mega Man in the west), and in decided to use this robotic hero as the model for their new battle-RPG series for Nintendo's handheld machines.</p><p>Proceeding into the analysis of the names themselves, there are going to be obvious <strong><u>spoilers</u></strong> in terms of characters, and as such the rest of the article will be about the importance of the names in relation to the grander scope of the narrative of the various games. I apologise if the vastness of the cast can seem overwhelming to the uninitiated.</p><p>The names are given in the traditional Japanese order of surname first, and the localised names are mentioned in brackets. I will comment on the localised names as well, if there is anything worthy of note in terms of the puns.</p><p><strong>Hikari Family:</strong></p><p><strong>Hikari Netto ("Lan Hikari"):</strong></p><p>光 – “light”<br>熱斗 - “passionate, heat” + “dipper, battle”<br><br>The hero of the game. 熱斗 is homophone with ネット (“computer network”). I noted the meaning “battle” because of how 斗 has been archaically used in the past as a contraction for 闘 (battle, <em>tou</em>). The localisation Lan literally refers to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network">LAN</a>, a computer network critical to local connections.</p><p><strong>Hikari Saito ("Hub Hikari"):</strong></p><p>光 – “light”<br>彩斗 - “colouring” + “dipper, battle”</p><p>The deceased twin-brother and navigation programme of Netto, essentially a posthumous brain-upload given digital form.  彩斗 is homophone with サイト (“website”). "Hub" here refers presumably to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_hub">Ethernet hub</a>, likewise a critical component for internet reception.</p><p><strong>Hikari Haruka ("Haruka Hikari")</strong></p><p>光 – “light”<br>はる香 - “<em>haru</em>” (phonetic script) + “fragrance”</p><p>The mother of the twins. はる is written in hiragana and such has on its own no apparent meaning, but usually is written with kanji such as 春 (“spring season”). Her forename is pronounced similar to 遥か (“distant”).</p><p><strong>Hikari Yuuichirou ("Yuichiro Hikari")</strong></p><p>光 – “light”<br>ゆういちろう - “<em>yuuichirou” </em>(phonetic script)</p><p>The father of the twins, and also the computer scientist who transformed Saito into Rock Man. The forename is also written in kanji as 一朗, whilst literally “help” + “one” + “cheerful”. I am not sure where the source for this name stems from. Perhaps after an employee at Capcom?</p><p><strong>Ijouin Family:</strong></p><p><strong>Ijouin Enzan ("Eugene Chaud"):</strong></p><p>伊集院 - “that” + “gather” + “temple”<br>炎山 - “flame” + “mountain”</p><p>The initial rival and then later friend of Netto, possessing a cooler mind in comparison to the hot-head, Netto. 伊集 is based off the similar sounding 委譲 (“transfer”), 炎山 w. 演算 (“calculation”). His forename can literally be glossed as “mountain of flames,” and as such the connotation of heat/fervour matches that of the 熱 in Netto’s name. <em>Eugene </em>is probably to match phonetically that of <em>Ijouin, </em>and <em>Chaud</em> is derived from a French word meaning <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/chaud#French">hot/warm</a> in reference to the literal meaning of <em>Enzan.</em></p><p><strong>Ijouin Shuuseki ("Shuseki Ijouin"):</strong></p><p>伊集院 - “that” + “gather” + “temple”<br>秀石 - “excellence” + “stone”</p><p>秀石 is homphonous to 集積 (“integration”).<br>The wealthy and estranged father of Enzan. Both his son’s forename and his own can be couple with 回路 (“circuit”, <em>kairo</em>) to produce computer-mechanical related words. Strangely enough his name is rendered the same as in Japanese.</p><p><strong>Friends of Hikari Netto and Hikari Saito:</strong></p><p><strong>Sakurai Meiru ("Mayl Sakurai"):</strong></p><p>桜井 - “cherry blossom” + “well”<br>メイル - “<em>meiru” </em>(phonetic script)</p><p>The girlfriend of Netto, whose name <em>Meiru, </em>メイル, is homophone with メール (“e-mail”), fitting in with the computer puns. The English localisation is literally just rewriting it to sounde lyke a Middle English name.</p><p><strong>Ooyama Dekao ("Dex Oyama"):</strong></p><p>大山 - “big” + “mountain”<br>デカオ - “<em>dekao</em>” (phonetic script)</p><p>Netto's friend, rival and would-be-bully, whose hulking frame puts him in contrast to his tiny little brother, Chisao. デカオ could be taken as a combination of でかい (“humongous”, <em>dekai</em>) and the common male name ending 男・雄 (“male”, <em>-o</em>).  <em>Dex </em>being short for <em>Dexter </em>was presumably used purely for its similarity to the Japanese name.</p><p><strong>Ooyama Chisao ("Chisao Oyama")</strong></p><p>大山 - “big” + “mountain”<br>チサオ - <em>“chisao</em>” (phonetic script)</p><p>A truly <em>little </em>little brother of Dekao. チサオ, mirroring that of his big brother, is derived from 小さい(“little”, <em>chiisai</em>) and the same male name suffix. The name remains as is in the English version.</p><p><strong>Ayanokouji Yaito ("Yai Ayanokoji")</strong></p><p>綾小路 - “figured cloth” + “lane” (“small” + “road”)<br>やいと - <em>“yaito</em>” (phonetic script)<br><br>Pint-sized rich girl. やいと is probably based off the same-sounding 灸 (“moxa cautery”, “chastisement”), thus referring to her caustic attitude and the fact that she is the scion of a respectable, wealthy family. Her name is shortened in the English version.</p><p><strong>Teachers:</strong></p><p><strong>Oozono Mariko ("Miss Mari"):</strong></p><p>大園 - “big” + “garden”<br>まりこ - “<em>mariko</em>” (phonetic script)</p><p>The class-room teacher of Netto and his friends. The name まりこ can be spelled variously, but the last element is nearly always 子 (“child”, <em>ko</em>), common suffix for female names. まり can also mean “ball,” though this merely seems to be a rhyme with her twin-sister ゆりこ (Yuriko), whose name is also written phonetically rather than in kanji. Her name in the English version is simply rendering it shorter and akin to the English female name, Mary, also adding the honorific <em>miss </em>to give the formality of being a teacher.</p><p><br><strong>Higure Yamitarou ("Higsby"):</strong></p><p>日暮 – “twilight” (“sun” + “livelihood”)<br>闇太郎 - “darkness” + “thick” + “son”</p><p>Fitting names for an eccentric character whose fishy nature is apparent at the start of the game where he pretends to be a maths-teacher, but later reveals to be a member of the criminal WWW organisation, where most of the villains in the series stem from. 太郎 (tarou, “thick” + “son”, <em>thick</em> here in the sense of healthy) is typically given as a suffix to the name of the eldest son of a family. The English name is yet another Anglicization of the Japanese original name. </p>

Yaguchi, who here uses jukujikun, writes out the characters for the name of the cake with 十二日節菓子, possibly to be read as <em>juuninichisaikashi</em>, which whilst literally meaning "cake for the 12 day festival," isn't as precise as Hori who uses the Japanese name for the Christian holiday of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelfth_Night_(holiday)">Twelfth Night</a>, 十二夜, <em>Juuni'ya, </em>lit. "(the) twelfth night. Yaguchi's word is regardless of this given the furigana <em>Toerufusukêki, </em>transcribing the English word's pronunciation into Japanese, picking creativity over specificity.</p><p><strong>Seething bowls of punch</strong></p><p>Kusano (1902) - 煮た煮たしたポンスの壜 - <em>Nitanitashita ponsu no bin - </em>"Jars of seething and seething punch"<br>Benibara (1911) -  煮た檸檬の汁を入れた皿 <em>Nita remon no shiru wo ireta sara - </em>"Dishes filled with seething lemon juice"<br>Yaguchi (1915) - 沸騰る混合酒の椀 <em>Takiru panchi no wan - </em>"Wooden bowls of seething Punch (lit.

"mixed alcohol"). I had initially thought that Benibara was using some unique non-standard reading for <em>remon, </em>檸檬 since the kanjis' individual readings didn't match the furigana, but it's a case of a loan-word that over time has been assigned a non-standard reading, akin to <em>tabako </em>(煙草, "tobacco, cigar, cigarettes", lit. "smoke herb"), which could strictly be read as <em>ensou</em>, but its more popular reading is derived from the Portuguese word for tobacco. Likewise 檸檬 would, if you were to take their 'proper' readings would produce <em>neimou</em>, but <a href="http://nihongo.monash.edu/cgi-bin/wwwjdic?1E"><em>remon </em>is the more common reading according to my web-dictionary.</a></p><p><strong>Plenty's horn</strong></p><p>Kusano (1902) - 豊年玉手箱 - <em>Hounen tamatebako - "</em>Tamatebako<em> </em>of the Fruitful Year"<br>Benibara (1911) - 豊年の神様が持つ玉手箱 - <em>Hounen no kamisama ga motsu tamatebako - </em>"Tamatebako<em> </em>akin to that owned by the Lord God of Fruitful Years"<br>Yaguchi (1915) - 山羊の角には似も付かぬ燃え盛る松明 - <em>Yagi no tsuno ni wa ni mo tsukanu moesagaru taimatsu - </em>A bundled blazing torch akin to a ram’s horn"<br>Nakajima (1920) - 手には澤山角〈希臘神話で豐饒の表象とされる角）<em>Te ni wa takusankaku &lt;gurisha shinwa de minori no shirushi to sareru tsuno&gt; - </em>"In his hand (he held a) plentiful horn &lt;a horn that is a mark (lit. "symbol"), according to Greecian myths, of harvest ("bountiful abundance").&gt;"<br>Hori (1928) - 豐饒角（五穀の神の持ってゐる山羊の角）- <em>Houjoukaku (gokoku no kami no motte iru yagi no tsuno) - </em>"A horn of bountiful abundance (the goat’s horn held by the God of Five Grains)"<br>Morita (1929) - 豊饒の角 - <em>Houjou no tsuno - "</em>Horn of Plenty/Cornucopia"<br>Yamanaka (1941) - <em>None</em><br>Yamamoto (1948) - <em>None</em><br>Katokt (2011) - 豊穣の角 - <em>Houjou no tsuno  - "</em>Horn of Plenty/Cornucopia" </p><p>Note:<br>The last item on the list and the torch of the jovial gigas himself, the Ghost of Christmas Present, whose appearance is closely fashioned after the figure of the Father Christmas during the Victorian periods as well as a towering man garbed in Roman-inspired raiment, complete with a wreath on his head. His symbol, the plenty's horn, or Cornucopia, has the translators annotate their choice for rendering this word. It is interesting to note that the two last words for the Cornucopia use different kanji for the second component, with said element highlighted:<br>豊<strong><u>饒</u></strong>の角 - lit. Horn of <strong><u>Abundant</u></strong> Bounty (<em>also</em> "Fertility/Fruitfulness")<br>豊<strong><u>穣</u></strong>の角 - lit. Horn of Bountiful <strong><u>Crops (<em>also</em> "Abudant Crops")</u></strong><br>The latter accentuating the Cornucopia's symbol as a marker of a rich harvest, and the former denoting abundance, whilst it can literally be read, if you use the radicals of the kanji as "food/eat (食) + sublime/tall (堯)", vividly conjuring up images of tall stacks of food. Nakajima's explanation of the concept, as you will note with the bracketed readings that show their literal meaning as opposed to the fanciful jukujikun, uses the kanjis of the first word for cornucopia in Japanese, 豊饒 (modernised form), which also means - as seen above - "fruitfulness" or "fertility", again referencing its agricultural nuances, but gives it the reading <em>minori </em>i.e. "harvest/crop", a sort of pars per toto, here as well. The word 表象 (<em>hyoushou, </em>"representation/symbol") is here given the reading <em>shirushi </em>("proof/mark") instead.</p><p>The first translations render the cornucopia into the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamatebako">tamatebako</a></em>, a treasure-box that famously appears in Japanese fairy-tales such as Urashima Taro,where the protagonist after saving a turtle is granted an audience with the Dragon King and Queen of the sea and as a token of their royal magnanimity they give him a treasure box, or <em>tamatebako - </em>hence the translation of cornucopia into the <em>tamatebako </em>could very well be to tell the Japanese audience of the opulent nature of the object.</p><p><strong>In conclusion:</strong></p><p>We can therefore see that a great amount of creativity has gone into making these translations - since they are in effect giving the Japanese audience the first taste of otherwise unknown varieties of cuisine, having to invent new terms and apply jukujikun to convey those meanings.</p><p>I sincerely hope that everyone have a most merry, splendid and convivial winter-time, whether you call it Christmas, Yule, Festivius, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturnalia">Saturnalis</a> or otherwise!</p><p>I shall now take a long and much needed winter respite.</p>

The term <em>niku</em>, 肉, does not cover the meat of fruits, but purely that of animals - therefore the Christmas tree becomes some sort of unholy meat-stool.</p><p>A more recent 1955 translation of his gives us:</p><p>もみの木は、こういってきくと、そばですずめたちが、さえずっていいました。「しっているよ、しっているよ、町へいったとき、ぼくたちは、まどからのぞいたから、しっているよ。みんなは、そりゃあすばらしいほど、りっぱになるんだよ。まどからのぞくとね、あたたかいおへやのまんなかに、小さなもみの木は、みんな立っていたよ。金いろのりんごだの、蜜のお菓子だの、おもちゃだの、それから、なん百とも知れないろうそくだので、それはそれは、きれいにかざられていたっけ。」</p><p>Where the contents are overall nearly identical to the above, but the segment with the "delicious meats" has been changed to 蜜のお菓子 (<em>mitsu no o-kashi, </em>"cakes of honey"), which better fints the Danish Christmas cakes. The sparrows use the pronoun <em>boku-tachi, </em>which fits their diminutive and eager nature, the following translation gives them a somewhat more courteous air, by Taketomo from sometime in 1925, going in reverse for a moment:</p><p>「私達は知っている、知っている」と雀が囀った。「向ふの町に、私達は窓から隙見したのだ。何處に行くか知ってますよ。あの木は想像される限りで一番華かに立派にすっかり裝飾られてゐます。私供は窓から覗いてすっかり解りました。暖い室のまん中に植えられて、金紙で巻いた林檎や蜜のお菓子や玩具や澤山の蝋燭などで一番美しく飾られてゐる事が」</p><p><em>"Watashi-tachi wa shitte iru, shitte iru," to suzume ga saezutta.

In the very midst of the warm room it was planted, decorated with rows of apples in gold-paper, cakes of honey, toys and plenty of lights and much more, being surely the most beautiful thing!" </p><p>The sparrows use the humble <em>watashi/watakushi </em>coupled with <em>tachi </em>(informal plural suffix) and <em>domo </em>(humble formal plural suffix), thus being much more decorous in their mode of speaking, even if they abbreviate the <em>te-</em>gerund of <em>iru </em>from <em>~teimasu</em> to <em>~te'masu, </em>which gives them a bit of an informal tinge, but otherwise their change from <em>watashi-tachi </em>to <em>watakushi-domo</em> seems to be a way of the sparrows apologising indirectly for prying into the rooms of the villagers. The honey-cake is preserved as is, rather than in successive translations becoming meat and then honey cakes again. The apples here appear in golden wrapping therefore being less gold coloured.</p><p>Next up and last in this article's items is:</p><p>『僕よりか小いのに、何處へ行くのだらう、僕なんざァ、這麼に大きくなってるのになァ』と、不審に思って居ましたら、雀の忠さんが、チウチウ囀りながら飛んで来まして、あの若い木は、どうも素晴らしい立派なお家の、暖たかいお座敷へ行って、大層榮耀榮華の生活をして居るので、<br>『僕が今しがた、窓から覗いて見て来たんだよ』と、詳しく話し聞かせて呉れました。</p><p><em>"Boku yori ka chiisai no ni, doko he iku no darou, boku wa nanzaa, konnani ookikunatteru ni naa," to, fushin ni omotte imashitara, suzume no Chuu-san ga, chu chu saezurinagara tonde kimasite, ano wakai moku wa, doumo subarashii rippa na oie no, atatakai, ozashiki he itte, taisou eiyou eika no kurashi wo shite iru node, "boku ga ima shigata, mado kara nozoi te mite kita 'nda yo," to, kuwashiku hanashikakasete kuremashita. </em></p><p>"Even smaller than me, I wonder where they are going. I've become so big..." said the Fir-tree in thinking to himself, but was interrupted mid-thought, by Mr. Tweet the Sparrow, who, flying forth, warbled with a tweet-tweet about how a young tree had gone to a warm <em>tatami-</em>room inside a magnificent house and concerning the extravagant luxury that the tree in particular was living in, "I saw this through the window, but a moment ago," and the Sparrow told them various things. </p><p>Once more the sparrow uses <em>boku</em>, but this time is named <em>Chuu-san </em>(忠さん, lit. Loyalty-<em>san</em>), but the kanji is chosen due to being homophone with the Japanese onomatopoeia for chirping, <em>chuu-chuu </em>hence my translation of it as "warbled tweet-tweet." The entire paragraph has been rewritten and all the panoply of Christmas decorations has been reduced to the Sparrow commenting on the lavishness that the tree in question enjoyed, presumably because Wadagaki found it difficult to translate the items listed in the material that he had at hand. We cannot be sure whether or not his source was German, French, English or even the original Danish, but something suggests that it isn't the last due to the thorough rewrite.</p><p>Ah, but wait for one jolly second!</p><p>We have a last and perhaps the one that features an avian transformation when it comes to the quizzical sparrows, courtesy of Hyakujima from the 1908, thus one of the very earliest of translations titled <em>Kurisumasu Tsurii </em>(くりすます樹, "the Christmas Tree"):</p><p>その時燕が傍から、『この方なら私が知って居るよ、私彼方の市街の窓から窺いて見たんだが………そんな樅木には玩弄品や、菓子や、人形や、凧や、羽根や、風船やまた澤山赤白等の蝋燭が飾ってあって、温い室の眞中に立ってゐた、そしてその飾といったら、立派で立派でなかなか御話なんかに出来ないんだ』</p><p><em>Sono toki tsubame ga waki kara, "Kono hou nara watashi ga shitteru yo, watashi mukau no machi no mado kara nozoite mita 'n daga......... Sonna momi no ki ni wa omocha ya, kashi ya, ningyou ya, tako ya, hane ya, fuusen ya mata takusan aka shiro nado no rousoku ga kazatte atte, atatakai heya no mannaka ni tatte ita, soshite sono kazari to ittara, rippa de rippa de nakanaka o-hanashi nanka ni dekinai 'n da."</em></p><p>'At that time, it came from the swallow, "If that's the case then I know, I peeked  and saw through the window of a nearby village, y'see... I couldn't tell you of the splendour of splendours of the way that the fir-tree in that warm room was decorated with toys, cakes, dolls, kites, feathers, small balloons, and yet an abundance of red and white lights!"'</p><p>The sparrow-turned-swallow is once more chirpy and less courteous than some of their literary successors, though they still use <em>watashi</em>, the gender-neutral pronoun which here when coupled with informal speech could suggest a female speaker since there is also an absence of polite speech outside of <em>o-hanashi, </em>an honorific version of <em>hanashi </em>(speech/story). There is an expansion of the decorations of the tree, though overall only the cakes remain and the apples are overall gone. Furthermore there is some playful usage of <em>furigana - </em>ruby text used to indicate the reading of words, such as more uncommon ones - where here words like <em>mukau </em>("nearby") uses the kanji 彼方 meaning "beyond/across/yonder", <em>omocha </em>("toy[s]") uses the kanji 玩弄品 ("playthings", lit. "toy articles", which a counter-word indicating items), <em>heya </em>("room") is using 室 ("room", though more general than just "living room", can also be "chamber"), where the kanji normally used for these three words would, in respective order of mentioning, 向, 玩具 and 部屋.</p><p>All in all the prolix bird, be it a sparrow or a swallow, provides the tantalising description that emboldens the fir-tree to his fatal living-room sojourn.</p>

    the fact of the matter is that the original japanese versions of the games do feature archaic speech, but only a handful of the characters who do sport a elizabethan diction in the english dub do so in the original version.  we'll be looking at those whose speech is the most markedly archaic in the english versions and then comparing them to the japanese originals - namely, demon souls, dark souls 1 ~ 3 and bloodborne. i will pick chiefly a few so representatives from each game to illustrate the archaic speech.   do note, dear reader, that spoilers are quite plentiful due to the nature of the topic.   therefore,  demon souls - the maiden in black and old king doran. dark souls 1 - gwendolyn, &quot;hawk-eye&quot; gough and gwyn dark souls 2 - rat king dark souls 3 - fire keeper, prince lothric and princess yorshka bloodborne - annelise cainhurst  these represent moderately to extreme elizabethan speech in the english dubs and are for this very reason suitable examples.   demon souls:   one's very first encounter with any line of dialogue, outside of the narration of the opening film, is that of the maiden in black (黒衣の火防女,  kuroi no himorime , &quot;black-garbed  protectrix  of the fire&quot;), whose final lines from the game reflect the stark relationship between the original japanese flavour of lines for the maiden and the english version's:   hark, i hear a voice of yore. the old one is calling for thee. let us proceed below to its lair.   this is prime shakespearean language, complete with   hark ,  yore   and  thee,  the latter being the object case for  thou  (second person singular), which aren't bad at all considering she is an ancient being working as the attendant for an eldritch existence called  the old one.   懐かしい声が聞こえます… 獣があなたを呼んでいるのです… 共に、獣の元に参りましょう…   natsukashii koe ga kikoemasu... kemono ga anata o yonde iru no desu. tomo ni, kemono no moto ni mairimashou.   &quot;i can hear a nostalgic voice. the beast appears to be calling for you. let us both proceed to the base of the beast.&quot;  all done in modern, non-archaic  keigo , polite speech.  does this then mean that all of the archaic speech in the english localisation is mostly just ad-libbed? i assume however that is not the case, since english voice acting was present in the original japanese version using the elizabethan lines that made it to the international versions.  one character  does  speak  proper  archaic language, the old king himself, his majesty doran, who lives the life of an ruin-dwelling weirdo that awaits adventures who stumble by his dilapidated residence and then proceeds to spout lines of heroic intimidation to challenge them. alas, poor doran, tedium seems a most painful thing for a monarch of his ilk.  the king, only wearing cerulean armour that clasps his naked ageing herculean manhood, spouts these first lines in the english dub:   thou who seeketh the king's sword! i am the old king. show me thine strength and the strength of thine souls. prepare thyself, brave knight.   which in the original were:  王家の剣を求める者よ 古き王の前で、そのかと、魂の価値を示すがよい  ouka no tsurugi wo motomeru mono yo. furuki ou no mae de, sonokato, tamashii no kachi wo shimesu ga yoi.  &quot;o seeker of the royal sword! show thy worth before i, the olden king&quot;  the english lines are from the original, so i cannot tell if they mended the horrible grammar such as  thine souls  instead of the more correct  thy souls  and not to mention other details in his language. the japanese version uses the archaic adjectival form  ~ki  rather than  ~i  in  furuki  (olden) and he uses the archaic imperative  ga yoi  rather than  ga ii,  which in itself is rather pompous sounding, literally, &quot;[you ought to] do [this]&quot;. the noun, &quot;sword&quot;, is here  tsurugi  in the japanese original, which is a poetic word for the ordinary pronunciation  ken.  剣, the kanji used, depicts and usually means a two-edged sword rather than the japanese 刀 (katana), though this is a minor point of interest.   dark souls 1:   gwyndolin, the hidden androgynous commander of the dark moon blades and crown prince of anorlondo, speaks in fully fledged archaic english when the player encounters the mist-veiled step before him,   halt! this is the tomb of the great lord gwyn. tarnished, it shall not be, by the feet of men. if thou art a true disciple of the dark sun, cast aside thine ire, hear the voice of mineself, gwyndolin, and kneel before me.   and the japanese original:  止まりなさい これより先は、大王グウェンの墓所 何人であれ、これを穢すことは許されない 汝、不敬の意志なく、正しく陰の太陽の使徒ならば 我グウィンドリンの声を聞き">

Furuki ou no mae de, sonokato, tamashii no kachi wo shimesu ga yoi.</em><br>"O Seeker of the Royal Sword! Show Thy worth before I, the Olden King"</p><p>The English lines are from the original, so I cannot tell if they mended the horrible grammar such as <em>thine souls </em>instead of the more correct <em>thy souls </em>and not to mention other details in his language. The Japanese version uses the archaic adjectival form <em>~ki </em>rather than <em>~i </em>in <em>furuki </em>(olden) and he uses the archaic imperative <em>ga yoi </em>rather than <em>ga ii, </em>which in itself is rather pompous sounding, literally, "[you ought to] do [this]". The noun, "sword", is here <em>tsurugi </em>in the Japanese original, which is a poetic word for the ordinary pronunciation <em>ken. </em>剣, the kanji used, depicts and usually means a two-edged sword rather than the Japanese 刀 (katana), though this is a minor point of interest.</p><p><strong>Dark Souls 1:</strong></p><p>Gwyndolin, the hidden androgynous commander of the Dark Moon Blades and Crown Prince of Anorlondo, speaks in fully fledged archaic English when the player encounters the mist-veiled step before him,</p><p><em>Halt! This is the tomb of the Great Lord Gwyn. Tarnished, it shall not be, by the feet of men. If thou art a true disciple of the Dark Sun, cast aside thine ire, hear the voice of mineself, Gwyndolin, and kneel before me.</em></p><p>And the Japanese original:</p><p>止まりなさい<br>これより先は、大王グウェンの墓所<br>何人であれ、これを穢すことは許されない<br>汝、不敬の意志なく、正しく陰の太陽の使徒ならば<br>我グウィンドリンの声を聞き、そこで跪くがよい<br><em>Tomarinasai.

Beyond this point be the burial place of King Gwen the Great. No matter who thou art, I shall not permit thy defiling of the place. If thou, possessing no blaspheming intentions, be a disciple of the Dark Sun, then hearken unto the voice of I, Gwendoline, and kneel before this point."</p><p>Both the official English localisation and the Japanese original script line up perfectly. The Crown Prince is none other than the son of an ancient sun god and victor of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theomachy">theomachy</a> that is depicted in the opening film as well as hinted throughout the game's many flavour texts. <em>Ware </em>("I"), <em>nanji </em>("thou") as well as the <em>gayoi</em> imperative mark his speech as that of a god to his followers. We ought to note right now that the English <strong>thou<em> </em></strong>is an informal pronoun, that originally signified either friendship, non-formality or intimacy, that is Gwendolyn's usage of the pronoun here is fitting since he not only is a prince, but also the commander of an order of knights, thus he thinks himself far above the concerns of lowly beings like the player's character. I would have said "mortals", but the player is a being that is caught in the nexus between the realms of the living and dead.</p><p>Gwyndolin's elder <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sororal">sororal</a> hologram, Gwynevere has also been outfitted with archaic English, take this line when the voluptuous sun-princess implores the hero to complete the royal eschatological quest:</p><p><em>Since the day Father his form did obscureth, I have await'd thee. Once living, now Undead, and a fitting heir to father Gwyn thou art, and beseech thee succeed Lord Gwyn, and inheriteth the Fire of our world.</em></p><p>And the Japanese original:</p><p>父が隠れて後、貴方を待っておりました<br>すなわち、人として不死となり、不死として英雄となる<br>父の後継者をお願いです<br>大王グウィンの後継として、世界の火を継いてください<br><em>Chichi ga kakurete ato, anata wo matte orimashita. Sunawachi, hito toshite fushi to nari, fushi toshite eiyuu to naru chichi no koukeisha wo onegai desu. Daiou Guven no koukei toshite, sekai no hi wo tsuite kudasai.</em><br>"Ever since Father did hide himself have I waited for You. Namely, You who becoming and Undead then became a hero, and thus do I implore you to become Father's heir. Pray, succeed King Gwen the Great, inheriting then the Fire of the World."</p><p>Same problem as with that of the Maiden in Black, where the Japanese version here uses <em>keigo </em>albeit much more formal and we have her using the kanji version of the pronoun <em>anata, </em>i.e. 貴方 rather than hiragana あなた, which underlines the solemnity of her wish. This is, however, going straight against how "thou" is an informal pronoun, talking <em>down </em>to the person whom one is addressing, whereas the Japanese version has the opposite with Gwynevere imploring the hero to succeed her father, King Gwen.</p><p>The same problem recurs with Dusk, an ancient noblewoman from the fallen kingdom of Oolacile, that also sports archaic Elizabethan lines where in the original she is merely very polite.</p><p>One of the knights in the game, the giant Gough, nicknamed the Hawkeye due to his unparalleled, apparently blind, archery, speaks in a similar if amiable Elizabethan manner, here he thanks the player after they have slain the corrupted form of the former Sir Artorias (Artorius in the original version), the leader of the band of Arthurian knights that Gough himself was a member of:</p><p><em>Hm? A visitor, have we?<br>Thou must be the one who freed Artorias.<br>An old friend he was, and thanks to thee…<br>He left this world with honour intact.</em></p><p>And the original Japanese version:</p><p>ほう、訪問者とは、珍しいこともあるものだ<br>もしや、アルトリウスを解放してくれた御人かな<br>ならば、古い友の誇りを守ってくれたこと　礼を言わねばなるまい<br>貴公に感謝する<br><em>Hou, houmonsha to wa, mezurashii koto mo aru mono da. Moshiya, Arutoriusu wo kaihou shite kure ta gojin kana. Naraba, furui tomo no hokori wo mamotte kureta koto rei wo iwanebanarumai. Kikou ni kansha suru.</em><br>"Oh, a visitor, this is a most rare thing. Mayhaps ye be Personage that freed Artorius, thus I owe you thanks for my old friend having preserved his honour. Gramercy."</p><p>Splendid and amiable, <em>kikou (</em>貴公, lit. "honourable duke") marks a middleground in terms of politeness, but clearly signifies that Gough is grateful towards the player. The pronoun also recurs throughout all of the Soulsborne games as the 2nd person pronoun of choice for knights and nobility, as we shall see later on in this article. Other points of interest is his usage of the old fashioned negative volitional conditional ~<em>banarumai </em>(I ought to ....; lit. "if I will not do this, it would be bad"). <em>~mai </em>corresponds to the more common <em>~naidarou, </em>and typically denoting "I will not want to ....". This conveys the image of a chivalric giant whose tone is one that is neither belittling nor aggrandising. He also uses <em>watashi </em>(私), which in this series is chiefly gender-neutral and often has tones of aloofness or nobility.</p><p><strong>Dark Souls 2:</strong></p><p>A single person in this game speaks in Elizabethan English, and a monarch no less, albeit not the mythical regents of the game's lore, rather it is a cthonic ruler taking the form of the Rat King, whose speech is properly regal. The player encounters him deep within his underground lair which is riddled with traps and a giant guard wolf, which once the player has endured these hardships, stumbles into the audience with the royal rodent, who has a less hospitable view of humans:</p><p><em>Leave this place, human. We have no time for thy kind. Humans bring nothing but filth.</em></p><p>立ち去るがよい、人間よ<br>余は、汝らの者と交わる気はない<br>穢らわしい人間よ、去るがよい<br><em>Tachisarugayoi, ningen yo. Yo wa, nanjira no mono to majiwaru ki wa nai. Kegarawashii ningen yo, sarugayoi</em><br>"Thou best leave, o human. We are loath to mingle with your kind. O odious human, get thee hence!"</p><p><em>Nanjira </em>("ye") the plural form of <em>nanji </em>("thou"), the Old Japanese pronouns, is coupled here with <em>yo </em>(余), whose meaning does not equate any meanings of majestic plurality, but the tone of his dialogue and status suggests that it has a nuance akin to it. 余 was historically and frequently used in written correspondence and by the aristocracy. Its usage nowadays in fiction tends to be for royalty or divinity, such as Emperor Palpatine (Star Wars), King Knight (Shovel Knight), Hades (Saint Seiya) and Imajin (Dragon Quest - The Emblem of Loto). He also employs the imperative <em>ga yoi.</em></p><p>King Vendrick from the same game has his speech translated into ordinary if old fashioned English, but uses <em>ware </em>(我) and <em>nanji </em>(汝) just like his compeers of the previous games:</p><p><em>As flame rises, so does it fade. Such is the way of things.<br>Do you intend to link the fire? Then you must first take the throne. Prove your worth. Find the ancient crowns. Seek adversity, and they will be yours. And your wishes, granted.</em></p><p>火は盛り、何れ消え行くが定め<br>汝、火を継ぐ者たらんとするか<br>全ては玉座にある者の意思<br>相応しき冠を求めよ<br>苦難を求め、古き冠を求めよ<br>全ては、その意思のままに…<br><em>Hi wa sakari, dore kieyuku ga sadame</em><br><em>Nanji, hi wo tugu mono taranto suru ka</em><br><em>Subete wa ouza ni aru mono no ishi</em><br><em>Fusawashiki kanmuri wo motomeyo</em><br><em>Kunan wo motome, furuki kanmuri wo motomeyo</em><br><em>Subete wa, sono ishi no mama ni ...</em><br>"The fire flourisheth, either way it fadeth away, such is its fate.<br>Thou art wanting to be the one who succeedeth the fire?<br>It is all the will of the person upon the throne<br>Wish thou for the most fitting crown,<br>Wish thou for suffering, wish thou for the ancient crown.<br>It is all for the sake of its will...."</p><p>Haunting words which are rendered into less ones in the localisation, with the former having all the gravitas of the memories of a doomed king.</p><p><strong>Dark Souls 3:</strong></p><p>The grammatical errors that plagued Demon's Souls and Dark Souls are gone, they were purged by the second Dark Souls and refined in the third game, with a greater part of the cast speaking in archaic English.</p><p>We encounter the younger sister of Gwyndolin of Dark Souls 1, Yorshka, whose speech in the English version is Shakespearean, for this manner of thing is apparently inheritable for the royalty of Anorlondo.</p><p>The player first encounter Her Highness through a daring itinerary on invisible mid-airs paths across the towering spires of the royal castle, where she sits besides the utmost corner of one of the towers:</p><p><em>Name thyself, stranger.<br>I am Yorshka, Captain of the Darkmoon Knights.<br>What beckoned thee to such a place?"</em></p><p>…どなたでしょうか？<br>私はヨルシカ。暗月の騎士団、その総長です<br>そして貴方は、何故こんな場所にいらっしゃいましたか？<br><em>...Donata deshou ka? Wata(ku)shi wa Yorshka. Angetsu no kishidan, sono souchou desu. Soshite anata wa, naze konna basho ni irasshaimashita ka?</em><br>"... May I ask who goes there? I am Yorshka, the Captain-General of the Darkmoon Knights. Wherefore would You, good sir/madam, be finding Yourself in a place like this?"</p><p>Decorous and using the <em>sonkeigo </em>(reverential speech) form of <em>iru </em>(to be), i.e. <em>irassharu </em>("the sir/madam is") when addressing the player, which perhaps is the reason for their making her speaking in an Elizabethan tone? But why the "thou"? The children of King Gwen the Great runneth thick with these royals, when it comes to thouing.</p><p>She appears more courteous towards the player than other characters in the series are, more so using <em>irassharu </em>rather than a neutral variant, considering her status as divine royalty. Nevertheless, she uses 貴方 (anata) in the kanji form and may or may not be using <em>watakushi </em>rather than <em>watashi, </em>the former the most humble way to express "I", since the kanji used is the one for both, but going by the level of polite speech and her role as an ancient princess it is probably <em>watakushi. </em>Gwynevere uses the same 貴方, but she knowingly addresses the Promethean hero of the game, whereas Yorshka hardly having seen nor heard about who the player is addresses them straight away in a polite tone.</p><p>Moving on to another member of royalty, the suspiciously avuncular king Ludleth, who greets the player when they enter the hidden sanctuary, which serves as the game's hub:</p><p><em>Oh, thou’rt unkindled, and a seeker of Lords. I am Ludleth of Courland. Look not in bewilderment as I say… I linked the fire long ago, becoming a Lord of Cinder. If substantiation be thy want, set thine eyes upon my charred corse. This sad cadav’r. No need to be coy, have a closer look.</em></p><p>And in Japanese:</p><p>ああ、君が火の無き灰、王の探索者だね<br>私は、クールラントのルドレス<br>信じられないかもしれないが…かつて火を継いだ、薪の王さ<br>その証拠に、未だこの体は、燻りに焼かれている<br>壊れた体だ。近寄れば、君にも見えるはずだよ<br><em>Aa, kimi ga hi no naki hai, ou no tansakusha da ne</em><br><em>Watashi wa Kûruranto no Rudoresu</em><br><em>Shinjirarenai kamoshirenai ga... katsute hi o tsuida, maki no ou sa</em><br><em>Sono shouko ni, imada kono karada, kusuburi ni yakarete iru</em><br><em>Kowareta karada da. Chikayoreba, kimi ni mo mieru hazu dayo</em><br>"Ah, dear chum, you are a fireless ashen, who jolly well seeks the kings?<br>I am Ludleth of Courland.<br>Perhaps it is too hard to believe, but I was formerly an heir to the fire, a King of Kindling.<br>The proof of this is my already charred and burned body. This ruined body. If you jolly want to come closer and look, then look, dear chum!"</p><p>The English script may render his speech into archaic English, as well as the voice acting for both versions - since the English voice acting is universal for both versions, but the script has him talking like the crazy uncle at a dinner party. His usage of <em>kimi, </em>which could be seen as a hearkening back to its olden meaning as an honorific pronoun meaning "Your Highness/Majesty", but his entire speech pattern plus the emphatic <em>ne </em>suggests that this is more in the line of "dear chum/pal/friend," hence my rendering it as such<br></p><p>Lastly, but not least, the Fire Keeper of this game speaks in a similar reverent tone towards the player in the Japanese version as the Maiden in Black did in Demon's Souls, likewise this is rendered in Elizabethan English, here her greeting to the player upon their entering the hidden sanctuary-hub: </p><p><em>Welcome to the bonfire, Unkindled One. I am a Fire Keeper. I tend to the flame, and tend to thee. The Lords have left their thrones, and must be deliver'd to them. To this end, I am at thy side.</em></p><p>The Japanese original:</p><p>篝火にようこそ、火の無き灰の方<br>私は火防女<br>篝火を保ち、貴方に仕える者です<br>玉座を捨てた王たちを探し、取り戻す<br>そのために、私をお使いください<br><em>Kakaribi ni youkoso, hi no naki hai no kata</em><br><em>Watashi wa himorime</em><br><em>Kararibi o tamochi, anata ni tsukaeru mono desu</em><br><em>Ouza o suteta outachi, o sagashi, torimodosu</em><br><em>Sonotame ni, watashi o otsukai kudasai.</em><br>"Welcome to the Bonfire, Fireless Ashen Personage.<br>I am the Protectrix of the Fire<br>I maintain the Fire and serve You, sir/ma'am.<br>To seek out and return the Kings who have lost their thrones,<br>For that very sake do I bid You please use my services."</p><p>Like Yorshka above she is courteous towards the Player, and here unlike the princess, she is serving the player who is destined to either bring an end to the chaos of the world or succeed. The construction <em>fireless ashen personage </em>is my conveying the nuance of <em>hi no naki hai no kata</em>, where <em>kata </em>is a polite word meaning "person/gentleman/lady/etc". Her lines are old fashioned, but not archaic.</p><p><strong>Bloodborne:</strong></p><p>We end our comparison of the games with the only person, as far as I know, who speaks archaic English in the Lovecraftian action RPG Bloodborne that pits the players, oneiric hunters against warped humanoid beasts, which eventually lead to clashing with the very forces of Cosmos.</p><p>Meet Annelise of Cainhurst, a vampire queen whose pronouns and tone hint towards her being one in a long line of immortal nobility taking residence in a baroque manor.</p><p>Later as the player's pact with the Vampire Queen progresses, should the player begin the side-quest, she will open up to them:</p><p><em>Speak not, those words. <br>We have little need of a consort. <br>Such a path would belike lead to further ruin. <br>Thou'rt dear to Us. <br>We would see no harm befall thee...</em></p><p>And the Japanese original version:</p><p>…やめておきたまえ<br>今はよい。だが、我が伴侶となるので<br>…おぞましい未来を見るだろう<br>貴公、私は貴公が大事だ<br>もう、失いたくはないのだよ…<br><em>...Yameteokitamae</em><br><em>Ima wa yoi. Daga, waga hanryo to naru node</em><br><em>... Osomashii mirai wo miru darou</em><br><em>Kikou, watashi wa kikou ga daiji da</em><br><em>Mou, ushinaitaku wa nai no da yo...</em><br>"Do stop with this.<br>Now is nice. However, if ye were to become my consort....<br>I see naught, but what would be a repulsive future.<br>Ye... Ye are my one and all.<br>I shan't want to lose you..."</p><p>In the English voice acting she uses the Majestic Plural and thous the player, which isn't completely off in terms of rendering 貴公 (<em>kikou</em>) as such, I merely chose "ye", the second person plural which from the 1100s to 1700s was used as a second person singular polite pronoun to distinguish it from less formal pronouns. The Majestic Plural is nowhere present in the Japanese original script and she plainly uses 私 (watashi) as her pronoun of choice, even the recent(ish) re-released Japanese version featured voice-acting that confirms this. Her tone is overall akin to that of the knights of the Souls games, implying a reciprocal respect between the two parties - look for example at Gough's lines. </p><p><strong>Final thoughts:</strong></p><p>I have nothing against archaic English in the SoulsBorne games, in fact I love it utterly to pieces, but it is interesting to note where in the original Japanese version there is actual archaic speech. The localisation effort of implementing an English translation to the game was not one of rendering a brand new English manuscript in terms of voice acting since the voice acting in all of the Japanese SoulsBorne games, with exception to Sekiro and the later addition of Japanese voice acting to Bloodborne, featured the English voice acting that is also shared with English version along with some of the international versions.</p><p>My main gripe with the series' Elizabethan English are its glaring grammatical errors that haunt its earliest instalments, but become less of a problem later on as the series nears its final titles. The most egregious example occurs during one of the endings for Dark Souls 1, where abyssal serpents will proclaim the newly crowned player with,</p><p><em>Our Lord hath returned'st…</em></p><p>Applying the second person singular ending to the past tense of a verb that along with the third person version of an auxiliary verb creates a mangled past perfect tense that for all intents and purposes would give us, in Modern English,</p><p><em>Our Lord has returneds</em></p><p>Despite its lack of the cases of Old, Middle and Elizabethan English, the sentence still looks utterly aberrant. The case could be made, "well, English <em>-s </em>only applies to the present tense of the third person, not the past tense," well my dear imaginary critic that obscures the point that I am trying to make, and <em>-s </em>derives from a dialectal transposing the 2nd person case unto the 3rd person, but that is another story for another time.</p>

  unlike our proto indo european idea of pronouns as in referent words with specific cases, such as subject, object, genitive, reflexive and so on, i.e. “ i, me, my, myself ,” in english, the system that governs similar words in most east asian languages and japanese in specific, is less fixed. any noun or personal name could in theory be a pronominal, hence the term ‘pronominal’ rather than ‘pronoun’, since the former denotes a word that has the ability or traits of a pronoun without directly having the exact same grammatical qualities. syntactically it is essentially identical to those of other world languages.  the word pronoun literally stems from the etymon, root-word, from latin that denotes a word that can replace or signify a name, ‘noun’ or literally a person’s name, or entity, being in its stead. thus, the pronoun itself is a syntactical representative of an inferred subject or object.  in a language such as japanese, traits have been developed as to signify an implied subject or object of a sentence to the point that the pronoun is rendered extraneous unless emphasis is needed. a cardinal rule of politeness in japanese discourse is to use any direct mode of pronominals as much as possible, thus ‘anata’, the standard polite 2 nd  person, usually heralds the honorific ‘-san’ at the end of a person’s name, once you know what their name is. anything else will seem too blunt or rude. similarly the whole linguistic system of  keigo  (respectful speech) is grammatically centred around removing the person, whom the speech concerns out, of any upfront reference, i.e. the polite passive tense effective removes the agency of the grammatical subject altogether.  you can effectively use your own name in an either excessive self-effacing or aggrandising manner, which is wherein a character from the manga, fist of the north star comes into play.   fist of the north star:   illustrated by tetsuo hara and written by buronson, this is a post-apocalyptic wu xia tale set in the barren landscape of a charred and desolate world, wherein it is the law of the strongest – our hero kenshirou, whose name roughly translates to  the fourth son of the fist , aptly named and aptly looking like a cross between bruce lee and sylvest “rocky balboa” stallone, protect the weak and punishes the corrupt with his titular  divine fist of the north star  (hokuto shiken).  his adoptive brothers, of whom raoh is one, play the active parts of allies and antagonists. raoh is in this case an ambivalent one, he is very much an ambitious warlord whose plan to subject all that he surveys under his fist, read: superhuman martial arts, ultimately leads towards a tragic path and confrontation with not only his former brothers, but also facing the horrifying truth of his crimes.  raoh is thus multifaceted and as such uses a host of pronominals to express his personality and self-acclaimed grandeur, having given himself the regal moniker of the fist king,  ken’ou –  his name, raoh, itself deriving from  shura no ou , “king of violence.” thus his name, title, personality and martial art denotes the antithesis to kenshiro’s role as the hero and similarly raoh in the end also redeems himself and serves as a means of kenshiro taking the mantle as the heir of the titular martial art – a role which is vaunted and wanted amongst the hokuto brothers.  having introduced this noble goliath with hands the size of mountains, let us delve into how he actually speaks.   the king of the fists and &quot;i&quot;:   raoh uses 10 forms of self-reference (“pronominals”):  ore, watashi, washi, raou, kono raou, ken’ou, kono ken’ou, ani, kono ani,  whereof the first three ( ore, watashi  and  washi ) are considered ‘true’ pronouns, and the latter are merely his own name, title and calling himself an elder brother to stress a nuance of relationship with his interlocutors.  let us take a closer linguistic look at these first three:   ore (おれ・オレ, &quot;i, the assertive male&quot;):   this pronoun is the most informal and assertive of all the pronouns available for male speakers in japan, it stands in direct contrast to the more amiable and non-confrontational  boku  (僕・ぼく・ボク), which in fist of the north star is mostly used by young males, for example kenshiro's elder adoptive brother toki in his youth, or children. its origins is that of a gender neutral dialectal pronoun, but it soon in the later centuries gained currency as an especially masculine way to speak.  one of his very first pronominal utterance as well as  ore  is this, he does however appear earlier in the manga, but without any self-reference, in the seventh volume of the manga:  この世に生を受けたからにはおれは　すべてをこの手を握る  kono yo ni ">

You think that your  can bring yourself on equal with footing with I!<br>There is no longer any man who can best himself against the fist of I!"</p><p>"With I" and "of I" reflect the distinct contrast in formality when compared to his usual <em>ore</em>, which thus amplifies the egocentric grandeur of his utterances.</p><p>This is not unlike Raoh, who has a habit of switching between pronominals mid-speech to shift to an increased level of dramatic oration or opposite revert to his original pronominal <em>ore</em>, when alarmed, angered or sad - the latter very much being him disillusioned with his power madness.</p><p>Within this example is the definite prefix <em>kono</em> used to further heighten his towering stature in terms of personality and physicality- it is not rare for Raoh to grow twice in height for dramatic effect whenever he faces off against weaker opponents.</p><p><strong>KONO ~ (この～, "I, this &lt;title/name&gt;)</strong></p><p>Thus we see him use his three pronominals, but as mentioned in the last paragraph adding this feature to them grants an increased assertion. He couples these sentences with archaic elements such as the <em>nu </em>negative, i.e. <em>oranu, </em>an negation of an archaic existential verb, <em>oru</em>, Where other regular characters use <em>iru </em>and itself negative form <em>inai</em>, thus setting himself apart from the rabble.</p><p>And he uses this third person mode of self-reference not much later in:<br><br>(...) そしてこの拳王の名を絶大にする<br>(...) <em>Soshite kono Ken’ou no na wo zettai ni suru</em><br>(…) Thus, shall the name of I, the King of Fists, be made absolute.</p><p>We could as well translate it without the first person singular in English, to further hone in the point of his sense of self-aggrandisement, but the addition “I” makes the sentence flow more naturally in English and also adds more pomp, in keeping the epic and archaic scope of the story and speech.</p><p>And referring to himself by his own name and by his own self-made moniker rather than an ordinary <em>I/me, </em>serving as a statement that he views himself in much greater and distorted dimensions than that of his fellow martial artists and people. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illeism">Historical figures such as the Roman leader, Gaius Julius Cæsar was famous for being an illeist, referring to himself in the third person,</a> which perhaps is not a random reference due to Raoh's Roman-inspired armour - again, conversely, the Japanese language allows for self-reference in this regard, so it is not wholly unique, but it adds a nuance to Raoh.</p><p>During his one of his confrontations with Toki, his brother, he refers to himself twice in the third person, once as a big brother and last as the King of Fists:</p><p>みごと　この兄を超え　この拳王の野望を砕いてみるがいい！！<br><em>Migoto kono ani wo koe kono Ken'ou no yabou wo kudaite miru gaii!!</em><br>"Splendid! Behold surpassing of I, your elder brother! The destruction of the ambition of I, the Fist King!"</p><p>His mode famous pronominal act and his very last words are these, as he blasts a whole into the clouded heavens:</p><p>わが生涯に一片の悔いなし<br><em>Waga shougai ni ippen no kui nashi</em><br>"There is naught that I regret in this my entire life!"</p><p><em>Waga</em> the posessive form of <em>ware</em>, the Old Japanese pronoun, which is used to this day in poetry and religious texts, as well as media taking place in olden times, is used to cement Raoh's supreme sense of regal majesty and that even at the very edge of death, having come to terms with his past transgressions does he regret anything.</p><p><strong>The Numbers of Dramatic Self Reference:</strong></p><p>I have painstakingly transcribed most if not all of Raoh's lines, which amount to a grand total of over 15.000 character <em>(plus minus personal annotations)</em>. And the total sum of the man whose ego is monumental is as follows:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/09/Raoh-pronouns.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="730" height="491" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/Raoh-pronouns.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/09/Raoh-pronouns.png 730w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>His, by far, most used is <em>ore </em>along with his own name and title. Other terms covered in the diagram are references to himself as <em>Hokuto no Choukei </em>("Eldest Brother of the North Star"), which also appear during his moments of boastfulness, though not with the definite prefix, <em>kono</em>.</p><p>His plural pronouns <em>ore-tachi </em>and <em>warera</em> are used contrasting, that is the former during his childhood and the latter during his last moments against Kenshiro. <em>Ore-tachi</em> is the default plural form of <em>ore </em>and is used when he as a child refers to himself and his little brother Toki as they swear a personal commitment to train their utmost in martial arts, and <em>warera</em>, an extremely formal and also here archaic plural pronominal, literally <em>ware </em>plus the plural suffix <em>ra, </em>thus giving hims speech what equates to Shakespearean gravitas in English.</p>

 vader： 大分衰えた様だな。  daibun odoroeta you da na.  it seems that you have weakened a  lot .  obi wan： 勝ち目はないぞ、ダース。私を斬り伏せた所で、お前など及びもつかぬ力で、私は蘇る。  kachime wa nai zo, dâsu. watashi wa kirifuseta tokoro de, omae nado oyobi motsukanu chikara de, watashi wa yomigaeru.  you have  no chance  in winning, darth. should you cut me down, then shall i revive with an even  greater power  than that of you!  vader： 戻ってくるべきではなかったな。  modotte kuru beki de wa nakatta na.  you should not have returned then.  so, both obi wan and vader use  watashi , a pronoun that in fiction if used informally and within the context of star wars signifies an elevated sense of dignity. furthermore they both use the informal pronoun  omae  towards each other signifying very much no respect whatsoever, but not one of great hostility either.  vader talks about it being fate or &quot;karmic&quot;, that obi wan returns to fight him and that he now is superior or has the upper hand. to which obi wan retorts that vader is naught but a master of &quot;evil deeds&quot;, rather than merely &quot;evil.&quot; both fencers use fairly masculine if archaic language with the old fashioned negation  nu  appearing instead of  nai  in some places.  obi wan's final line about returning stronger than ever should vader cut him down is furthermore stipulated by obi wan flat out saying that he will be revived thus alluding to his appearance as a spirit in the later portions.   the first official film dub:   vader： 待っていたぞ、オビ・ワン・ケノービ。やっと再会出来たな。 これで全てが幕を閉じる。 嘗てお前の弟子だった俺が、フォースの支配者になるのだ。  matte ita zo, obi wan kenôbi. yatto saikai dekita na.   kore de subete ga maku wo tojiru.   katsute omae no deshi datta ore ga, fôsu no shihaisha ni naru noda.  i have been waiting for you, obi-wan kenobi. at last we are able to meet again. this time it shall all come to an end. formerly i was your apprentice, but now it is me who have become the ruler of the force">

Obi-Wan calls Vader by what at the time is his forename and retroactively his ceremonial title as a Sith, and Vader mocks Obi-Wan for being a crippled "old man."</p><p>That Obi-Wan calls Vader a mere "master of evil," rather than overall becoming superior in power to him and that Obi-Wan finally hints at his ghostly return should Vader slay right on the spot.</p><p>And, lastly, their literal way of talking in terms of pronouns and grammatical traits.</p><p><strong>Star Wars - The Story (1979)</strong></p><p>Vader:<br>この日を待っていたぞ、オビ・ワン。<br>ついにお前に会えたな。因果が巡ってきたのだ。あの頃は未熟だったが、今では私の方が上だ。<br><em>Kono hi wo matte ita zo, Obi Wan.</em><br><em>Tsuni omae wa aeta na. Konnan ga megutte kita noda. Ano koro wa miuku dattaga, ima de wa watashi no hou ga ue da.</em><br>I have been awaiting this day, Obi-Wan.<br>At last I meet you. It is karmic that you return. Back then I was but inexperienced, but now I am the superior.</p><p>Obi Wan:<br>悪事にかけてはな、ダース。<br><em>Akuji ni kakete wa na, Dâsu.</em><br>Only in terms of evil deeds, Darth!</p><p>Vader：<br>大分衰えた様だな。<br><em>Daibun odoroeta you da na.</em><br>It seems that you have weakened a <em>lot</em>.</p><p>Obi Wan：<br>勝ち目はないぞ、ダース。私を斬り伏せた所で、お前など及びもつかぬ力で、私は蘇る。<br><em>Kachime wa nai zo, Dâsu. Watashi wa kirifuseta tokoro de, omae nado oyobi motsukanu chikara de, watashi wa yomigaeru.</em><br>You have <em>no chance</em> in winning, Darth. Should you cut me down, then shall I revive with an even <em>greater power</em> than that of you!</p><p>Vader：<br>戻ってくるべきではなかったな。<br><em>Modotte kuru beki de wa nakatta na.</em><br>You should not have returned then.</p><p>So, both Obi Wan and Vader use <em>watashi</em>, a pronoun that in fiction if used informally and within the context of Star Wars signifies an elevated sense of dignity. Furthermore they both use the informal pronoun <em>omae </em>towards each other signifying very much no respect whatsoever, but not one of great hostility either.</p><p>Vader talks about it being fate or "karmic", that Obi Wan returns to fight him and that he now is superior or has the upper hand. To which Obi Wan retorts that Vader is naught but a master of "evil deeds", rather than merely "evil." Both fencers use fairly masculine if archaic language with the old fashioned negation <em>nu </em>appearing instead of <em>nai</em> in some places.</p><p>Obi Wan's final line about returning stronger than ever should Vader cut him down is furthermore stipulated by Obi Wan flat out saying that he will be revived thus alluding to his appearance as a spirit in the later portions.</p><p><strong>The first official film dub:</strong></p><p>Vader：<br>待っていたぞ、オビ・ワン・ケノービ。やっと再会出来たな。<br>これで全てが幕を閉じる。<br>嘗てお前の弟子だった俺が、フォースの支配者になるのだ。<br><em>Matte ita zo, Obi Wan Kenôbi. Yatto saikai dekita na.</em><br><em>Kore de subete ga maku wo tojiru.</em><br><em>Katsute omae no deshi datta ore ga, Fôsu no shihaisha ni naru noda.</em><br>I have been waiting for you, Obi-Wan Kenobi. At last we are able to meet again.<br>This time it shall all come to an end.<br>Formerly I was your apprentice, but now it is me who have become the ruler of the Force!</p><p>Obi Wan:<br>そうはさせんぞ、この悪魔め。<br><em>Sou wa sasen zo, kono akuma me.</em><br>I shall not permit it, you damn devil!</p><p>Vader:<br>力が衰えたようだな。<br><em>Chikara ga odoroeta you dana.</em><br>It appears that your powers have weakened.</p><p>Obi Wan:<br>儂には勝てんぞ。たとえ倒しても、儂は無限の力を与えられて、蘇るのだ。<br><em>Washi ni wa katen zo. Tatoe taoshite mo, washi wa mugen no chikara wo ataerarete, yomigaeru no da.</em><br>You cannot win over me. Even if you fell me, then shall I be granted infinite powers and be resurrected!</p><p>Vader:<br>お前を永遠に葬ってやる。<br><em>Omae wo eien ni houmotte yaru.</em><br>I shall bury you forever!</p><p>Where the audio-play version was far more literal in its rendition of the original script, the dub makes it sound even more poetic and elaborates on some of the details. It also adds a lot of characteristics to the language versus the flavourless sound of "<em>watashi ~ omae</em>."</p><p>Vader uses <em>ore, </em>the masculine assertive informal pronoun, to underline his strength in comparison to his elderly ex-master and Obi Wan uses <em>washi</em>, the generic old folk pronoun, that gives him the aura of an old Jedi Knight. Vader uses <em>omae </em>to show spite towards his former master, where had they still been master and apprentice one would had expected to see Vader use <em>watashi</em> and <em>anata </em>(the polite 2nd person pronoun), which he indeed uses when talking to the Emperor - a scene that we will be covering in a later article.</p><p>Obi Wan outright calls Vader a "damn devil" or "cursed fiend" rather than "master of evil" in this version which adds more aggression to his otherwise cool composure when meeting his former Padawan. Vader likewise isn't merely a "master" now, but a "ruler" of the "Force." Hence Obi-Wan's angry remark.</p><p>Now, no longer does Obi Wan say that the power which he will achieve surpasses Vader's comprehension, but that it is simply "infinite" or "unlimited" which strangely presages the appearance of Palpatine's much memed line in <em>Episode III: Revenge of the Sith</em>, when the wrinkled Sith Master blasts Mace Windu with Force Lightning.</p><p>Again, here Obi-Wan states his spiritual resurrection, to which Vader remarks that we shall perform the last rites and make them eternal.</p><p><strong>Star Wars: A New Hope (manga):</strong></p><p>Vader：<br>待っていたぞ　オビ＝ワン<br>これでようやく決着がつく<br>以前はあなたに学びましたが　今や私は全てを修めた！<br><em>Matte ita zo Obi Wan</em><br><em>Kore de youyaku kecchaku ga tsuku</em><br><em>Izen wa anata ni manabimashitaga ima yara watashi wa subete wo osameta!</em><br>I have been waiting, Obi Wan<br>With this will it at last be brought to a conclusion<br>Previously I was under Your gracious tutelage, but now I have mastered everything!</p><p>Obi Wan:<br>ーーだが　修め方が戻っておらんな<br>– <em>daga osameta hou ga modotte oran na</em><br>– However, you can’t return back to studying then, what?</p><p>Vader:<br>衰えたな<br>最早　昔日の力は見られぬ！！<br><em>Odoroeta na</em><br><em>Mohaya sekijitsu no chikara wa mirarenu!!</em><br>You have weakened.<br>Already now I am unable to observe your power of old!</p><p>Obi Wan:<br>お主にはわかるまいな<br>例えこの身が滅びようとも<br>大いなる理力の輪廻に回帰し更なる力を得て戻って来るぞ<br><em>Onushi ni wa wakarumai na</em><br><em>Tatoe kono mi ga horobiyou tomo</em><br><em>Ooinaru riryoku no rinne ni kaiki shi sara naru chikara wo ete modotte kuru zo</em><br>You still do not want to understand, do you.<br>Indeed, even if this body should perish,<br>I would return having acquired great power from returning from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%E1%B9%83s%C4%81ra">samsara</a> of the Force.</p><p>Vader:<br>フン！<br>大人しく引っ込んでおればよいものを！！<br><em>Fun!</em><br><em>Otonashiku hikkonde oreba yoi mono wo!!</em><br>Hmph! It is best for you to obediently withdraw all together!</p><p>Of all the adaptations of the scene, this one is the most extensive. The manga adaptation with text and art by Hisao Tamaki, released in 1999, revised the confrontation between Obi Wan and Vader and had them clash in a pyrotechnical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iaido">quick-draw</a> display of swordplay.</p><p>As can be see Obi Wan once more uses <em>washi, </em>but also uses <em>onushi,</em> an archaic 2nd person pronoun that in tone is the same as <em>omae, </em>but fits samurai-style speech as well, and Vader starts with using the <em>desu</em> mode of speech, i.e. <em>teineigo </em>(polite speech) aspect of <em>keigo </em>(respectful speech), but drops it altogether when they start attacking each other, thus very much merely being Vader putting up a facade of being reverential towards his former master. Obi Wan counters this by rejoining that this "gracious tutelage" (my rendering of Vader's polite speech) would very much prove futile upon his <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/obstreperous">obstreperous</a> student. </p><p>Vader's comment about Obi Wan's waning might of the past is even more scathing than just calling him an oldster, and Obi Wan's line about reappearing stronger with the implied nature of becoming a ghost has taken a much more Buddhistic nuance with him mentioning the great nature of the Force as being akin to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%E1%B9%83s%C4%81ra">the Wheel of Rebirth, Samsara.</a></p><p>Furthermore, Vader's "you should not have come back" in the original becomes a cold inveigh against Obi Wan rather than merely either telling him to perish or that he should not have met with Vader.</p><p>Vader's speech as well as Obi Wan's is much more archaic. Vader uses the existential verb <em>oru </em>and couples it with the positive particle <em>yoi </em>to produce <em>orebayoi </em>(you would/should be better have been), therefore giving him the grave aura of a lord of the Sith, and adding more gravitas to his confrontation with Obi Wan, who here uses the volitional negative <em>wakarumai </em>(does not want to know), along with Vader using the archaic negation <em>nu </em>rather than <em>nai</em>, as seen in one of the previous versions.</p><p>I prefer this version in some regards even if it is more an adaptation of Lucas' original script, since it adds a bit more depth to the characters and their personalities as former apprentice and master become more evident in the way that they interact with each other.</p>

 thus in a poetic mode of contrast hanzou reflects the life of a lone ninja and in the english localisation it appears that he is making fun of himself.   shiranui gen'an:   last, but not least, the troglodyte fusion of gollum and freddy krueger, shiranui gen'an, whose weapon of choice is a massive gauntlet with great claws. his way of talking is essentially taking the traits of the generic geriatric sociolect and making it repulsive, from the victory quote prior to his ending:  ケケケケケ‥‥　どうだケ、ぬしもワシと魔道へ堕ちてみんケ？  ke ke ke ke ke.... dou da ke, nushi mo washi to madou e ochite min ke?

            <article id="the-aegyptian-stork" class="gh-post" data-search-content=" the tale of the ugly duckling ( den grimme ælling ) is perhaps hans christian andersen's most famous tale - part autobiographical story about striving against the odds, and part celebration of the sublimity of nature.  whilst a full analysis of the linguistics and narrative elements of the fairy-tale in translation would be fascinating, it would also be a vaster task than i currently have time for at the moment, thus i decided to take a look at perhaps a minor if decisive line in the very beginning of the fairy tale, where the stork is described as speaking egyptian &quot;as he was taught by his mother.&quot;  these  ciconid  bringers of babies and eater of frogs, were rumoured to turn into their human shapes once they received their native land of egypt, according to mary tartar's erudite commentary on a collection of andersen's tales translated into english.  the line in particular is:   der var saa deiligt ude paa landet; det var sommer, kornet stod guult, havren grøn, høet var reist i stakke nede i de grønne enge,  og der gik storken paa sine lange, røde been og snakkede ægyptisk, for det sprog havde han lært af sin moder.    &quot;it was so lovely out in the country; it was summer, the corn was yellow, the wheat green and the hay was piled in stacks down in the green meadow,  and there walked the stork on its long red legs and prattling egyptian, for that was the language that he had been taught by his mother.&quot;    (own translation, the relevant sentences have been marked in bold.)  thus, there are three important artefacts of translation: the name of the animal, the description of its long legs, prattling egyptian and the fact that it was taught so by its mother.  before we enter the two translators that i have chosen for this short essay, let's look at the good bird itself.  in japanese it is called   kounotori   and uses the character 鸛.ordinarily it is written in biology texts as コウノトリ, using the katakana script, since the character that is used to write the bird is a complex one and thus it is easier to also write and distinguish it in written form. it also serves to differentiate it from the similarly looking kanji 鶴 ( tsuru , &quot;crane&quot;), which likewise is sometimes written in katakana as ツル ( tsuru ).  this will hopefully be covered in another article.  therefore, without further ado, let us look at the translations:   ueda (1911):   野に出て見ると何も彼も美しく見える夏の事、小麦は黄色に、燕麦（からすむぎ）は青く緑色濃き牧場（まきば）には 枯草（かれくさ）の幾堆（いくむら）が立って居て、長い赤い足で歩きまわってる鸛は品のいい阿母（おっかあさん）から習って埃及語（エジプトご）で喋舌（しゃべ）って居る。    no ni dete miru to nani mo kare mo utsukushiku mieru natsu no koto, komugi wa kiiro ni, karasumugi wa aoku midoriiro koki makiba ni wa  karekusa no ikumura ga tatteite, nagai akai asi de arukimawatteru kounotori wa hin no ii okkaasan kara naratte ejiputogo de shabette iru.    &quot;when one got into the fields, very much everything that you could see was of rendered beautiful by summer, the wheat was yellow, the oats were immersing the feeding grounds in an unripened shade of green and  amidst all the numerous dry grass was the stork with his long red legs, wandering about, chattering the egyptian language that his refined mother dearest had given him lessons in.&quot;   kazutoshi ueda, featured on this blog in terms of covering his various translations of fairy-tales, has rendered the passage in the most faithful manner if adding a few details of his own such as describing the mother as  refined  (品のいい,  hin no ii , &quot;a good article&quot;), which can also mean &quot;genteel&quot;

                    <p>The tale of the Ugly Duckling (<em>Den Grimme Ælling</em>) is perhaps Hans Christian Andersen's most famous tale - part autobiographical story about striving against the odds, and part celebration of the sublimity of nature.</p><p>Whilst a full analysis of the linguistics and narrative elements of the fairy-tale in translation would be fascinating, it would also be a vaster task than I currently have time for at the moment, thus I decided to take a look at perhaps a minor if decisive line in the very beginning of the fairy tale, where the stork is described as speaking Egyptian "as he was taught by his mother."</p><p>These <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stork">ciconid</a> bringers of babies and eater of frogs, were rumoured to turn into their human shapes once they received their native land of Egypt, according to Mary Tartar's erudite commentary on a collection of Andersen's tales translated into English.</p><p>The line in particular is:</p><p><em>Der var saa deiligt ude paa Landet; det var Sommer, Kornet stod guult, Havren grøn, Høet var reist i Stakke nede i de grønne Enge, <strong>og der gik Storken paa sine lange, røde Been og snakkede ægyptisk, for det Sprog havde han lært af sin Moder.</strong></em></p><p>"It was so lovely out in the country; it was summer, the corn was yellow, the wheat green and the hay was piled in stacks down in the green meadow,<strong> and there walked the stork on its long red legs and prattling Egyptian, for that was the language that he had been taught by his mother."</strong> </p><p>(Own translation, the relevant sentences have been marked in bold.)</p><p>Thus, there are three important artefacts of translation: the name of the animal, the description of its long legs, prattling Egyptian and the fact that it was taught so by its mother.</p><p>Before we enter the two translators that I have chosen for this short essay, let's look at the good bird itself.</p><p>In Japanese it is called <em><a href="http://sibagu.com/japan/ciconiidae.html">kounotori</a> </em>and uses the character 鸛.ordinarily it is written in biology texts as コウノトリ, using the katakana script, since the character that is used to write the bird is a complex one and thus it is easier to also write and distinguish it in written form. It also serves to differentiate it from the similarly looking kanji 鶴 (<em>tsuru</em>, "crane"), which likewise is sometimes written in katakana as ツル (<em>tsuru</em>).</p><p>This will hopefully be covered in another article.</p><p>Therefore, without further ado, let us look at the translations:</p><p><strong>Ueda (1911):</strong></p><p>野に出て見ると何も彼も美しく見える夏の事、小麦は黄色に、燕麦（からすむぎ）は青く緑色濃き牧場（まきば）には<strong>枯草（かれくさ）の幾堆（いくむら）が立って居て、長い赤い足で歩きまわってる鸛は品のいい阿母（おっかあさん）から習って埃及語（エジプトご）で喋舌（しゃべ）って居る。</strong></p><p><em>No ni dete miru to nani mo kare mo utsukushiku mieru natsu no koto, komugi wa kiiro ni, karasumugi wa aoku midoriiro koki makiba ni wa <strong>karekusa no ikumura ga tatteite, nagai akai asi de arukimawatteru kounotori wa hin no ii okkaasan kara naratte ejiputogo de shabette iru.</strong></em></p><p>"When one got into the fields, very much everything that you could see was of rendered beautiful by summer, the wheat was yellow, the oats were immersing the feeding grounds in an unripened shade of green and <strong>amidst all the numerous dry grass was the stork with his long red legs, wandering about, chattering the Egyptian language that his refined mother dearest had given him lessons in."</strong></p><p>Kazutoshi Ueda, featured on this blog in terms of covering his various translations of fairy-tales, has rendered the passage in the most faithful manner if adding a few details of his own such as describing the mother as <em>refined </em>(品のいい, <em>hin no ii</em>, "a good article"), which can also mean "genteel" and "gracious, as well as using the archaic word 阿母 (<em>aba</em>), where the word consists of "<em>a</em>", an archaic honorific typically used for either women's names or expressing a light degree of politeness towards the subject, hence "mother dearest" in my translation - this, however, is given the reading <em>okkaasan</em>, "mommy," a far more colloquial term for one's mother.</p><p>His described as talking <em>Egyptian</em> (埃及語 <em>ejiputogo</em>) using the old fashioned ateji spelling - phonetically based, not semantically -  for the country, rather than the now modern エジプト (<em>ejiputo)</em>. This term in general refers to the old pharaonic Egyptian language of antiquity rather than the Arabian unrelated one of modern times.</p><p>The stork, <em>kounotori</em>, is roaming about, <em>arukimawatte</em>, and chattering, <em>shaberi, </em>the language. <em>Shaberi </em>("chattering") here is given the non-standard kanji writing - jukujikun, as the way of spelling is known, - 喋舌, an, on the surface of things, uncommon compound word that would be read as <em>chouzetsu, </em>lit. "speaking in/with the tongue," presumably meaning to chatter or prattle.</p><p>I say "would be read," because apparently <a href="https://furigana.info/w/%E5%96%8B%E8%88%8C">its usage was a popular variant way of writing <em>shaberu </em>("to chatter/talk")</a>, where the ordinary kanji-based orthography is 喋る<em>, </em>here using the first kanji of the former compound, 喋, lit. "talk/chat/chatter".</p><p><strong>Nakajima (1921):</strong></p><p>野山の眺めの美しい夏のことでした。麥はもう黄色に色づいた中に、ところどころまだ青い燕麥（からすむぎ）がまじり、緑色の秣場（まぐさば）には、<strong>乾草が山のやうに積み上げられた間が、あの長い、赤い脚をした鸛が、母親から教はった言葉で、何かしきりにしゃべりながら、あちらこちらと俳徊（うろつ）いてゐます</strong>。</p><p><em>Noyama no nagame no utsukushii natsu no koto deshita. Mugi wa mou kiiro ni iroduita naka ni, tokorodokoro mada aoi karasumugi ga majiri, midoriiro no magusaba ni wa, <strong>hoshikusa ga yama no you ni tsumiagerareta aida ga, ano nagai, akai ashi wo shita kounotori ga, hahaoya kara osowatta kotoba de, nani ka shikiri ni shaberi nagara, achira kochira to urotsui te imasu.</strong></em></p><p>"The view of the hills and dales of summer was beautiful. The wheat was in the middle of ripening to a yellow colour, here and there the blue oats were mingling, thus rendering the feeding grounds green, <strong>and within the mountainous stacked hay, the stork loitered about hither and thither, incessantly chattering the words that his own mother had taught him."</strong></p><p>Nakajima Kotou is also no stranger to this blog when it comes to covering his works. He is most prominently featured on this blog in regards to his translation of  <em>A Christmas Carol </em>by Charles Dickens.</p><p>Here the stork no longer speaks any specific ancient language, but merely endlessly gibbers the words that his mother had taught him. He is no longer wandering about, but is clearly "loitering", where the kanji 俳徊 (<em>haikai, </em>lit. loiter/roam/saunter) is given the furigana <em>urotsui </em>(to prowl, to wander about aimlessly). "Hither and thither" or alternatively "to and fro," translates こちらどちら (<em>kochira dochira, lit. </em>"here and where") and is used to denote aimless movement, here strengthening the stork's seemingly brainless meandering and babbling.</p><p>Thus, Ueda's is the oldest and conveys the most, if adding something of his own, of the original Andersen text, and Nakajima simplifies things and removes entire details and renders the stork a perplexed mess of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/macrology">macrology</a> and prowling.</p>

            <article id="the-foul-mouthed-miller" class="gh-post" data-search-content=" geoffrey chaucer, factotum of plantagenet england and author of countless inimitable works of poetry, wrote towards the end of the 1400s his magnum opus  the canterbury tales,  wherein we follow a wide assortment and slice of society as they make pilgrimage towards canterbury.  chaucer was a man whom had interacted with everyone from the highest to the lowest in 14th century england from kings to serfs, and had even travelled europe and communicated with the princes of that time. it is therefore little wonder that the cast of his  tales  stem from such diverse societal layers as millers, knights and friars.  japanese translations of this middle english do exist, albeit fewer than other english works. i will in this short post look at perhaps one of the most colourful characters of the poem who gives no fucks about swearing upon god, his organs or other divine items, much to the ire of his fellow pilgrims, and chaucer having meekly to apologise to the reader.  how does a japanese translator from the early 20th century then handle the sulphurous tongue of robin the miller?   the most prominent swear from robin is probably this one, occuring when the innkeeper tells robin the miller to politely let the monk tell his story, to which robin replies:  'by goddes soul,' quod he, 'that wol nat i;/for i wol speke, or elles go my wey.' ('by god's soul,' said he,'that will i not; for i will speak, or else go my way')  &quot;by god's soul (...) that will i not&quot; is very much the middle english equivalent of &quot;i fucking well won't,&quot; due to how religious swears were much more potent back then.  japanese swearing works somewhat differently, with it being more sociolinguistically dependent, that is, ranging from using the wrong pronoun (informal versus formal), or dropping honorifics. there is, however, slang and profanity akin to our own, typically deriving from the realm of the sexual or religious, for example  chikushou  means &quot;livestock&quot; or &quot;beast (of burden)&quot;, but can be used as a fairly mild expletive, but once it is used as a term of spite towards another person it is very much equivalent of &quot;you fucker,&quot; since the term in buddhist religious context refers to  one of the realms of rebirth, that is the animal realm.   thus, we turn towards the japanese translation from 1926, which was done by kenji kaneko (金子健二, 1880 - 1962) and the it was released in two volumes, whereof the miller's tale, was part of the first one.  returning to robin's reply to the innkeeper:  「いや止さぬ。どうしても話すんだ。ならぬなら勝手な事をする。」  &quot;iya yosanu. doushite mo hanasu nda. naranu nara katte na koto o suru.&quot;  &quot;nay, i'll not stop. i will absolutely tell this story. if not, do as you please!&quot;  no swear word in site, but only overly informal speech, plus archaic elements such as  yosanu  rather than the modern  yosanai  (&quot;stops not&quot;).   elsewhere robin attempts to use polite language, but because he is more more dipped in plonk than dionysus, he fails in quite his unique style, first using  sessha  (拙者, &quot;this clumsy one&quot;), a pronoun typically used by samurai when self-deprecating themselves:  「大丈夫其のお侍の相手は拙者が引き受けて一つ面白いお話をお耳に入れよう」  &quot;daijoubu sono o-samurai no aite wa sessha ga hikiukete hitotsu omoshiroi o-hanashi o o-mimi ni ireyou.&quot;  &quot;it is all right, humble i shall be the one to challenge the good sir knight's story with a most interesting one for you all!&quot;  which corresponds to:  'i can a noble tale for the nones,/with which i wol now quyte the knightes tale.' ('i can a noble tale for sure, with which i will now match the knight's tale')  that very much comes prior to the former quote where robin swears upon god that he will tell a story. notice how the translator has used  o-samurai,  an honorific version of  samurai , as a localisation for &quot;knight,&quot; hence my translation choice.  the only one to seriously swear in this part is the innkeeper himself where he furiously admonishes robin:  「糞！話すなら話せ、馬鹿野郎！！　氣を狂ってゐるがる。」  &quot;kuso! hanasu nara hanase, bakayarou!! ki o kurutte iru garu!&quot;  &quot;damn it! if you must tell, then tell, you bloody idiot! you have lost your mind!&quot;  and even this is remarkably unprofane in its meaning.  it is true that  kuso  (糞, &quot;dung/shit/faeces&quot;) can mean literally &quot;shit,&quot; but it can also run the gamut from &quot;fucking hell&quot; to &quot;darn it.&quot; it is a common expletive, whereas  bakayarou ( 馬鹿野郎, &quot;damn/bloody idiot&quot;) could perhaps be stretched to be considered mildly profane, but even then it is hardly as profane as the innkeeper's original line:   (...) 'tel on, a devel wey!/thou art a fool, thy wit is overcome.'  (by the devil, do continue! thou art a fool, thy wit is extreme.&quot;)  where in our day and age &quot;by the devil,&quot; is not only fairly mild, but it is outright archaic and you would probably only encounter it it dickensian works at the utmost, when it comes to modern works.

            <article id="quick-post-pardon-my-rudeness" class="gh-post" data-search-content=" hearkening back to one of  my earlier posts  where i remarked on how some characters in japanese comics would use an overly assertive or informal pronoun, i.e.  ore , when speaking in  keigo , polite speech, i encountered the element in probably one of the most egregious cases.  case in point:    wherein akechi meets a local lord and half-arses his introduction.   in the game  sengoku musou 5 , or  samurai warriors 5  as it is known in the west, is a game that has just been released in japan, based off the popular  musou  franchise of games and also japanese medieval history.  akechi mitsuhide , a fictionalised version of the japanese samurai of the same name, and his vassal  toshimitsu saitou , also based off a real historical person, meet  yoshikage asakura , the lord of echizen.  said lord meets them after they have fled from an attempted death-by-fire and asakura greets them after which akechi apologise their rudeness and gives a &quot;proper&quot; introduction:  これはご無礼を…俺は明智十兵衛光秀と申します。…して義景様、越前にいったい何が…？  kore wa goburei o... ore wa akechi juubee mitsuhide to moushimasu. shite yoshikage-sama, echizen ni ittai nani ga...?  &quot;do apologise our rudeness... i'm this dude called akechi juubee mitsuhide. apropos, lord yoshikage, what on earth is echizen...?&quot;  now, all of the characters in this game, the returning one at that, have received a rehash in their design and personality, which include speech patterns, as such akechi who previously would speak in pitch-perfect  keigo  to whomever he met, employs in this latest iteration  goburei,  the honorific form of  burei  (impoliteness/rudeness),  mousu  (to be humbly be called/named), but whereas his former self would use  watashi  or perhaps even  watakushi , he uses  ore  the de-facto assertive informal male pronoun that sticks out like a pair of grotesquely polka-dotted bermuda shorts at a formal office meeting.   thus, even though akechi prefaces his introduction with apologising for having been discourteous towards the lord asakura, he outright messes it up with the  ore  in his very stating who he is.  his vassal, saitou, however is through and through polite, having earlier asked his lord:  お待ちくだされ、殿！　どうか休息をお取りいただきたい…  omachi kudasare, tono! douka kyuusoku o otoriitadakitai...   &quot;please wait, my lord! i entreat your lordship to have some repose...&quot;  and said character also uses  soregashi  (某, &quot;this one&quot;), a self-deprecating archaic pronoun, and you can also hear it when you select him prior to a mission:  殿、某に万事に任されよ  tono, soregashi ni banji ni makasereyo  &quot;my lord,pray, entrust all tasks unto this humble one!&quot;  using the archaic passive-respectful imperative of  makaseru  (to entrust; to leave to someone to perform), thus this is technically how akechi  ought to have spoken  to lord asakura.   it appears that using  ore  is a firm part of akechi's characterisation in this game being a more assertive and macho version of his previous self?  this is not the first time that this happens in the game nor the series, something which i shall look into in a future post.

(...)  dette er den tredobbelte super-saiya-jin!   &quot;don't say that. now i'm normal and now... ... super saiyan! and this is how the doubled super saiyan looks like! also known as an ultra saiyan...! (...) this is the threefold super saiyan!&quot;  (volume 40, lysmand)  not merely does lysmand translate it, but he purposely invents an extra name for the transformation, &quot;ultra saiyan,&quot; as well as an explanatory if amended translation to spell out the literal meaning of the japanese name. then he links it all together with the &quot;threefold super saiyan,&quot; being a descriptor to the aforesaid &quot;mega saiyan.&quot;  i quite like the danish translation of the line that bobbity says in relation to when son goku announces that he will show them the super saiyan 3:   mega turbo, nå ja... lyder ikke så originalt! nå ja, må vi se?  &quot;mega turbo, well yes, doesn't sound all too inventive! well then, may we see it?&quot; (volume 40, lysmand's translation)  and here is toriyama's line for good measure and comparison:  …なにをいってるのかサッパリだ… スーパーなんとかがこえてこえた…？ なんのこっちゃ…   ...nani o itteru no ka sappari da...   suupaa nantoka ga koete koeta...?   nanno koccha...   &quot;whatever you said sounded rather neat... something super something that surpassed something? whatever that is...&quot; (volume 40, toriyama)  which doesn't quite hit the same sarcasm and ridiculing of the superlative naming scheme with the &quot;super&quot; element, though lysmand's adds a new scathing level to it.

            <article id="hans-of-the-clog" class="gh-post" data-search-content=" in the place of another large project to take care of, i thought we'd take a look at some of andersen's lesser known works and how they have been treated in translation.  hans christian andersen's shorter tale,  klods hans  (&quot;hans with the clogs&quot; named so due to wearing  træsko,  &quot;clogs&quot; and being a  klods, &quot; clumsy/foolish person&quot;, lit. &quot;block/brick&quot;), features three brothers of landed-gentry stock, all wanting to impress and marry the princess of the local kingdom, whose single wish to hear something fascinating - which hans' two elder brothers aspire to do by way of showing their grandstanding erudition by quoting law and latin, two thing which they ultimately and detrimentally fail and all the more to increase the luck of their eccentric little brother. hans does in the end win the respect of the princess by manner of his goat, a dead crow-turned-dinner and a wooden shoe-turned-cooking pot and finally the seasoning of pocket-mud - all which impress the princess more than hans' two pompous poseur brothers.  so, the framing narrative is rather straight-forward, as are the central characters: two pompous elder brothers, an eccentric if rustic young brother, named hans, and the princess.  personality wise we would expect to see hans' eccentric and rustic personality reflected in the translation as to communicate that which is shown in the original story - and how they contrast his personality to that of his learned brothers.  we shall be looking at translations from two people, mitaku fusako and kusuyama suekichi, both of whom are not unknown faces to this blog in terms of translations hans christian andersen's fairy-tales. mitaku's work is from 1920, and kusuyama's is from 1945, thus the two translations are relatively close, only twenty-five years apart.   the elder brothers:   mitaku gives the brother's proclamation of their intent and impressing her royal highness:  『僕たちはこれから王様の御殿へ行って、王女様にお會ひするんだ。王女様のお聟さんになりたいと思ふ者は誰でも行って、王女様にお目にかかることができるとふお布令が出たことを、お前は知らないのか』   &quot;boku-tachi wa korekara ousama no goten e itte, oujosama ni oai surunda. oujosamano omukosan ni naritai to omou mono wa dare dem o itte, oujosama ni omenikakaru koto ga dekiru tou ofure ga detakoto wo, omae wa shiranai no ka&quot;   &quot;we intend to go to his majesty's palace and visit the royal princess. did you not know that her highness made an official notice that she granted an audience with those who wish to become her suitor?&quot;  this being their reply to hans' asking why their are wearing such fine clothes. the brothers use  boku-tachi  (僕たち, &quot;we, young men&quot;), essentially an informal pronoun that does give off an aura of learnédness. hans, however, also uses  boku  and polite language when talking to his father and the princess.  the brothers also use quite a few honorifics when referring to the princess, namely:  oujosama  (lady royal princess), whereof  sama  is a more decorous version of  san; omukosan  (lit. &quot;honourable mister suitor&quot;), where  o-  and  -san  turn the common noun  muko  into an honorific noun, the kanji used for  muko  (&quot;husband&quot;), 聟, is relatively uncommon and literally means &quot;son-in-law,&quot; but in japanese  muko  covers the meanings of &quot;groom; son-in-law; husband.&quot; the more common variant is 婿. the most polite verb in this vocabulary is  omenikakaru  (&quot;to humbly cast one's eyes upon&quot;), which is used as a humble term for the verb  au  (&quot;to meet&quot;), here translated as &quot;grant an audience with,&quot; in context of the princess permitting a potential suitor to present himself. lasty there is  ofure  (&quot;honourable official notice&quot;), which is literally the regular term for an official notice or proclamation with the honorific  o-  added.  quoth kusuyama:  「王さまのお姫さまは、おれがもらうよ。」  &quot;ousama no ohimesama wa, ore ga morau yo&quot;  &quot;i should like the royal daughter of the king.&quot;  less decorous than mitaku's version and very much just stating the brother's intending to court her royal highness with  morau  (&quot;to want; to need&quot;), which is essentially crude and completely varnished of politeness as compared to  oaisuru  (&quot;to honourably meet&quot;), which was used in mitaku's.  no wonder the princess declined the brothers' request in this version.   hans the clog-head:   hans' way of speaking in mitaku's translation is relatively unlike his rustic self in the original and instead he speaks akin to a polite youth both to his family and to the royals, using  boku  (僕) as his pronoun, whereas kusuyama has him use  ora  (おら), a dialectal informal pronoun that is stereotypically used in media as the go-to pronoun when portraying bumpkins. ultimately the pronoun is derived from  onorera  (己等), an archaic plural pronoun, whereof  onore  is also the source of the modern masculine  ore.   without a further ado, let us take some concrete examples from the two translators, taking the scene where hans tells his father of his plans of betrothing the princess:  mitaku: 『僕も王女様のお聟さんにならうと思ふんです。』  &quot;boku mo oujo-sama no o-muko-san ni narou to omoun desu.&quot;

Ultimately the pronoun is derived from <em>onorera </em>(己等), an archaic plural pronoun, whereof <em>onore </em>is also the source of the modern masculine <em>ore.</em></p><p>Without a further ado, let us take some concrete examples from the two translators, taking the scene where Hans tells his father of his plans of betrothing the Princess:</p><p>Mitaku:<br>『僕も王女様のお聟さんにならうと思ふんです。』<br><em>"Boku mo oujo-sama no o-muko-san ni narou to omoun desu."</em><br>"I am considering taking the hand of the Royal Princess in marriage."</p><p>Kusuyama:<br>「おらも、お姫さんほしくてならないのだ。お姫さまが、おら、もらいたいといえば、もらわしてやる。それから、おら、もらわないといっても、やっぱりお姫さまもらっちまう。」<br><em>"Ora mo, ohimseama hoshikute naranai noda. Ohimesama ga, ora, moraitahi ieba, morawashite yaru. Sorekara, ora, morawanai to ittemo, yappari ohimesama moracchimau."</em><br>"I too fancy m'self the Lady Princess. Either amma gonna get her or I ain't gonna get Her Highness. Therefore, I'll or I ain't gonna get no Princess, at all!"</p><p>Hans is far more concise and polite in Mitaku's version, using the adequate honorifics, <em>o-muko-san</em>, and also applies <em>-desu</em>, the polite copula to his speech. All in all, there is not much separating his diction from that of his educated elder brethren - poignantly illustrated by the elevated <em>boku </em>(僕, "I, the young man").</p><p>Kusuyama however goes nearly all out with rendering Hans' speech in that of a rural bumpkin, replete with <em>ora </em>as his personal pronoun and the colloquial <em>chimatta </em>versus that of <em>shimatta</em>, "to do something wholly." He does address the Princess with <em>ohimesama</em>, which is the proper honorific term for daughter of nobility or royalty. Mitaku's, conversely, uses <em>oujo-sama, </em>whereof <em>oujo</em> is technically the correct way to refer to a royal daughter.</p><p>However, Kusuyama not just gives Hans <em>ora</em>, but also <em>oira </em>(おいら) an even more colloquial version of <em>ora</em>, that gives him an aura of eccentricity.</p><p>When Hans then finally meets Her Highness after his two brothers' failed attempts at impressing her, we get these two different versions of Her Highness giving an audience to Hans. Hans here presents His Highness with a dead crow in the hopes of getting it roasted since the Princess remarked that they are cooking food:</p><p>Mitaku:<br>『そいつは有難い。ぢゃこの烏も焼けるでせうね』<br><em>"Soitsu wa arigatai. Ja kono karasu mo yakeru de shou ne"</em><br>"Well, that's welcome! Do you suppose, that I can roast this grow then?"</p><p>Kusuyama:<br>「じゃあおらも、からすをやいてもらいましょうや。」<br><em>"Jaa ora mo, karasu wo yaite moraimashou ya."</em><br>"Well, y'see, I's also got a crow that I wanna roast!"</p><p>Both versions of Hans use polite language whereas  Kusuyama's continues to use the informal <em>ora </em>and Mitaku's is thorough in using <em>boku</em>, a far more polite if still informal first person pronoun, but still more fitting when meeting a royal. Hans, however, as proven throughout the story is quite something of his own, and Kusuyama even adds <em>ya, </em>a dialectal emphatic particle at the end, to add the colloquial nature of Hans' speech even when attempting at being polite. Furthermore, he uses <em>moraimashou </em>("I'd like to have"), where the proper humble form would be <em>itadakimashou</em> ("I humbly would like to have), when requesting to have the crow roasted.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Princess, who uses decorous if imperious language in both versions, grants him her hand in marriage after he impresses her with not just a crow casserole, but also his manner of serving it in a clog (his namesake) and spiced with a generous sprinkle of dirt. So wholly unlike Hans' two rigid brothers that the Princess prefer him over them. </p>

Jibun wa baka na no darou ka, to kubi wo kashigemashita. Demo sou omoitaku arimasendeshita. Daijin wa mawari wo miwarimashita.</em></p><p>"'This is most ghastly!' thought the Cabinet Minister. That he himself was perhaps an idiot, he would certainly get sacked, he thought. However, he did not wish to think like that. The Cabinet Minister walked about and took a closer inspection."</p><p>Little to no direct here, apart from the brief exclamatory reaction which runs through most of the story. Of what can be seen, however, he uses generic elderly speech, closely resembling the Hiroshima dialect, such as seen with the sentence ending copula <em>ja</em>, corresponding to the standard <em>da</em> or <em>dearu.</em></p><p><strong>The Swindlers:</strong></p><p>As previous articles in this series have shown, the pair are known for not just their ability to present questionable articles of clothing that reveals the vocational competence of the observer, but also for being as linguistically slick as anguilline critters.</p><p>Thus, when the pair wish for His Majesty to disrobe himself and don the newly "made" ones:</p><p>Quoth Oohata's new translation:</p><p>「陛下、おそれながら、お召し物をおぬぎあそばされますよう。」と、ぺてん師もはいいました。<br>「手まえどもも、つつしんで、この大鏡のまえで、新しいお召し物を、お着せ申しあげるでございましょう。」</p><p><em>"Heika, osorenagara, omeshimono wo onugi asobasaremasuyou." to, petenshi mo wa iimashita.</em><br><em>"Temae-domo mo, tsutsushinde, kono ookagami no mae de, atarashii omeshimono wo, okisemoushiageru de gozaimashou."</em></p><p>"If we may be as bold to ask, Your Majesty, if You would deign to unrind Yourself of Your Majesty's current Imperial Raiment." said the Swindlers.<br>"We worthless lot may then most humbly, in front of that grand mirror, clothe Your Majesty in this new Imperial raiment, if the Majesty so wishes, most noble sire!"</p><p>As in his last translation the Swindlers use the archaic humble pronoun <em>temae </em>in its plural form <em>temae</em>-<em>domo</em>, lit. "the humble thing before the hand." I also mentioned previously, that it is nowadays used as a derogatory second person pronoun with the sense of "you bastard," in English.</p><p>Quoth Ookubo:</p><p>「どうか王さま、ただいまおめしになっている服をおぬぎになって下さいませんか？」 (…)<br>「よろしければ、大きなかがみの前で王さまのお着がえをお手伝いしたいのです。」</p><p><em>"Douka ousama, tadaima omeshi ni natteiru fuku wo onugi ni natte kudasaimasenka?"</em><br>(:::)<br><em>"Yoroshikereba, ookina kagami no mae de ousama no okigae wo otetsudai itashitai no desu."</em></p><p><em>"Please, King, if You would deign to gracious declothe Yourself of your favourite robes?"</em><br>(:::)<br><em>"If it so pleases His Majesty, would the King then place Himself in front of the large mirror, then we may be able to assist the King in dressing the King in the new Royal Clothes."</em></p><p>Much more of a standard fair in terms of politeness, though we see a few <em>o-ni-naru </em>constructions, i.e. "the gentleman/madam does X", such as <em>omeshi-ni-natteiru </em>(to clothe, to fancy), and <em>onugininatte </em>(to dress oneself). It is not as self-abasing as Oohata's with <em>moushiageru </em>(to humbly perform; to humbly express) being the auxiliary verb, where this one uses <em>itasu </em>("to humbly do"), which is the standard way of forming a humble verbal construction, where <em>itasu </em>also typically becomes the suppletive humble auxiliary verb instead of the like of the ordinary <em>suru </em>("to do"), in neutral/informal speech.</p><p>Both of them are ennobled in the original with the title of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weaving">væver</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junker">junker</a></em>, and likewise Oohata and Ookubo translate these titles:</p><p>Oohata: <em>orimono kizoku </em>(織り物貴族, "Weaver Noble")<br>Ookubo: <em>oukoku tokubetsu hataorishi </em>王国とくべつはた織り士, "Special Weaving Experts to the Kingdom") </p><p>Thus Oohata does it literally and Ookubo elaborates on their courtly profession as serving as the His Majesty's official tailors.</p><p><strong>"But he wears nothing at all!":</strong></p><p>We then for the last time reach this part of the article where the words of a child brings the imperial clothing illusion crashing down.</p><p>Quoth Oohata:<br>「だけど、なんにも着てやしないじゃないの。」<br><em>"Dakedo, nanni mo kite yashinai janai no."</em><br>"However, he ain't wearing anything at all at all!"</p><p>A colloquial rendition and sounds like a child could have said it, though do note that <em>~yashinai janai </em>(lit. "does not" + "it is not"), needn't imply a double negation as in English, but merely serves to strengthen the contents of the statement.</p><p>Oohata, however, renders it utterly literally:</p><p>「でも、王さま、はだかだよ。」<br><em>"Demo, ousama, hataka da yo."</em><br>"But, the King is naked!"</p><p>Which was the translation choice of some of his predecessors.</p><p><strong>Final remarks:</strong></p><p>Thus we round off well over a century of translations of a monarch whose predilection for clothing, changing vicissitudes of offices of monarch-hood, going from emperor to king and then to even greater titles, and duplicitous tailors.</p><p>I will in the future perhaps write an article in regards to the dizzying amount of honorific expressions that are used in these, but for now this concludes our odyssey of the translations of this particular fairy-tale spanning from 1888 to 1982.</p><p>Thank you for being the literary travelling companion - and no that is <em>not </em><a href="https://www.andersenstories.com/en/andersen_fairy-tales/the_travelingcompanion">a reference to an upcoming project.</a></p><p>心から、ブロッゴポストをご耽読くださいましてありがとうございます, 皆々様<br>Thank you very much, for having thoroughly read these blog-posts, ladies and gentlemen!</p>

            <article id="princess-tamaeda" class="gh-post" data-search-content=" whilst researching for upcoming projects in relation to the next work to compare and analyse, i came across various japanese translations of andersen's   de vilde svaner  (&quot;the wild swans&quot;)  - which involves a young princess by the name of elisa, who must save her eleven cursed brothers who have been turned into swans by her wicked stepmother, whose wiles has entranced elisa's kingly father.  most japanese versions render her name as  eriiza  (エリザ) in the katakana script, but one version in particular opts for giving her a japanese name instead.  wadagaki kenzou (和田垣謙三, 1860 - 1919), whom is no stranger to this blog, since we covered his translation of  the emperor's new clothes  before, included a translation of the fairy-tale in the very same volume (published in 1910) that includes said tale of sacerdotal imperial swindling.  here is the paragraph in question from the original danish, the bracketed translation is mine:   langt borte herfra, der hvor svalerne flyver hen, når vi har vinter, boede en konge, som havde elve sønner og én datter, elisa.   (far away from here, where the swallows fly to, when we have winter, lived there king who had eleven sons and one daughter, elisa.)  and wadagaki:  むかし、さる國の王様に、十二人の王子と、一番末の玉枝姫といふ、都合十二人のお子様がありました。   mukashi, saru kuni no ousama ni, juuninin no ouji to, icibansue no tamaeda-hime to iu, tsugou juuninin no o-ko-sama ga arimashita.   &quot;long ago, in a distant land lived there a king who had eleven princes and in the very end his favourite daughter, who was called princess tamaeda; all in all he had twelve children.&quot;  the reference to swallow, the boreal country and the emigration of said birds have all been abridged away to reduce the size of the fairy-tale, which is one of andersen's longer ones, though not at all the scope of  the snow queen.   most interestingly elisa becomes tamaeda-hime, whose name literally breaks down as &quot;princess jewelled twig/branch,&quot; which makes for a name that references nature, presumably elisa's original wintry home, and the kanji for jewel or jade, 玉, was anciently used to refer to the imperial families of china and japan, hence it could also be a reference to her status as royal princess.   the name is also constructed akin to the name of actual nobleladies both fictional and real, whereof the former has the selenian   kaguya-hime  , for example. the word  hime  does not necessarily refer to the daughter of a monarch, but can also refer to the daughter of nobility.  the word itself is ultimately from a compound meaning &quot;daughter of the sun&quot; (old japanese &quot; pi no me&quot; ), appearing as a common part of goddess names in shintoism, and probably referencing its ancient usage as a title of nobility.

                    <p>Whilst researching for upcoming projects in relation to the next work to compare and analyse, I came across various Japanese translations of Andersen's <a href="https://www.andersenstories.com/da/andersen_fortaellinger/de_vilde_svaner"><em>De Vilde Svaner </em>("The Wild Swans")</a> - which involves a young princess by the name of Elisa, who must save her eleven cursed brothers who have been turned into swans by her wicked stepmother, whose wiles has entranced Elisa's kingly father.</p><p>Most Japanese versions render her name as <em>eriiza </em>(エリザ) in the katakana script, but one version in particular opts for giving her a Japanese name instead.</p><p>Wadagaki Kenzou (和田垣謙三, 1860 - 1919), whom is no stranger to this blog, since we covered his translation of <em>The Emperor's New Clothes </em>before, included a translation of the fairy-tale in the very same volume (published in 1910) that includes said tale of sacerdotal imperial swindling.</p><p>Here is the paragraph in question from the original Danish, the bracketed translation is mine:</p><p><em>Langt borte herfra, der hvor svalerne flyver hen, når vi har vinter, boede en konge, som havde elve sønner og én datter, Elisa.</em></p><p>(Far away from here, where the swallows fly to, when we have winter, lived there king who had eleven sons and one daughter, Elisa.)</p><p>And Wadagaki:</p><p>むかし、さる國の王様に、十二人の王子と、一番末の玉枝姫といふ、都合十二人のお子様がありました。</p><p><em>Mukashi, saru kuni no ousama ni, juuninin no ouji to, icibansue no Tamaeda-hime to iu, tsugou juuninin no o-ko-sama ga arimashita.</em></p><p>"Long ago, in a distant land lived there a king who had eleven princes and in the very end his favourite daughter, who was called princess Tamaeda; all in all he had twelve children."</p><p>The reference to swallow, the boreal country and the emigration of said birds have all been abridged away to reduce the size of the fairy-tale, which is one of Andersen's longer ones, though not at all the scope of <em>The Snow Queen.</em></p><p>Most interestingly Elisa becomes Tamaeda-hime, whose name literally breaks down as "princess jewelled twig/branch," which makes for a name that references nature, presumably Elisa's original wintry home, and the kanji for jewel or jade, 玉, was anciently used to refer to the Imperial families of China and Japan, hence it could also be a reference to her status as royal princess. </p><p>The name is also constructed akin to the name of actual nobleladies both fictional and real, whereof the former has the selenian <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_the_Bamboo_Cutter">Kaguya-hime</a></em>, for example. The word <em>hime</em> does not necessarily refer to the daughter of a monarch, but can also refer to the daughter of nobility.</p><p>The word itself is ultimately from a compound meaning "daughter of the sun" (Old Japanese "<em>pi no me"</em>), appearing as a common part of goddess names in Shintoism, and probably referencing its ancient usage as a title of nobility.</p>

Why, His Majesty shall be most exceedingly pleased when I shall humbly tell him!"</p><p><em>Washi </em>is confirmed and the usage of the humble verb for "to report" or "to say", <em>moushiageru</em>" is also used. Both Taketomo and Oohata present him as an old, flustered, but courteous gentleman.</p><p><strong>The Swindlers:</strong></p><p>The Swindlers as is per the tradition of the fairy-tale speak with the utmost decorum, perhaps too much, Taketomo renders their request for His Majesty to undress and dress in the new garbs as:</p><p>「それでは恐れ入りますが、お召物を脱き遊ばしますやう。この大鏡のまへで御新調のお召物をお着せ申しますでございませう」</p><p><em>"Sore de wa osoreirimasuga, omeshimono wo nuki asobamasuyou. Kono ookagami no mae de goshinchou no omeshimono wo okisemoushimasu de gozaimashou."</em></p><p>"If we may be as bold as to ask Your Majesty to deign to derobe Yourself of Your Royal <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/raiment">Raiment</a>, then, pray, if Your Majesty would place the Yourself in front of the grand mirror to graciously try out the new robes that we may garb Your Majesty in the new <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/raiment">raiments</a>, if Your Majesty would deign to do so."</p><p>Of note we have <em>asobasu </em>(遊ばす, "the monarch does", lit. "to play; to frolic") as an auxiliary reverential verb denoting the action of His Majesty undressing Himself. They also add <em>degozaimasu </em>to the final <em>~masu </em>of the humble verb just to make it superfluously oleaginous.</p><p>Oohata gives us:</p><p>「陛下におかせられては、おそれながら、おめしものをおぬぎあそばしますよう。」 (...)<br>「手前ども、つつしんで、この大鏡の前で、新しいおめしものを、おきせ申しあげるでございましょう。」</p><p><em>"Heika ni okaserarete wa, osorenagara, omeshimono wo onukiasobashimasuyou." (...) </em><br><em>"Temae-domo, tsutsuhinde, kono ookagami no mae, atarashii omeshimono wo, okisemoushiageru de gozaimashou."</em></p><p>"If Your Majesty relocate Your Gracious Self, then, pray, if we may be as bold to petition that Your Majesty be divested of Your current raiment." (...)<br>"We most simple lot, shall most meekly with Your Majesty in front of the grand mirror apply the new royal raiments to Your Majesty, pray if our sire pleases to do so."</p><p>Same application of <em>degozaimasu </em>to a polite verb, but we also see <em>temae-domo</em> used as a humble pronoun, in a rather archaic fashion versus that of its modern usage as a derogatory or insulting second person pronoun, lit. "that which is in front of (your) hand," hence the English rendition. The pluraliser <em>domo </em>is added here to add a further sense of humility, cf. its usage in the construction <em>watakushi-domo</em>, "we humble lot," the most humble modern Japanese pronoun.</p><p>And when their are ennobled by His Majesty:</p><p>Taketomo: <em>Goyoutateya </em>(御用織匠, Royal Weavers)<br>Oohata: <em>Orimono kizoku </em>(織物貴族, "Textile Noblemen")</p><p>Both are approximations of the Danish <em>væver<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junker">junker</a>, </em>but are less verbose than some of their predecessors. 織匠 is given the irregular reading of <em>tateya, </em>"weaving professional", whereas it on its own would be <em><a href="https://kotobank.jp/word/%E7%B9%94%E5%8C%A0-534180">shokushou</a>, </em>the word itself is rather rare.</p><p><strong>"He is wearing nothing at all!"</strong></p><p>And thus we reach the crescendo of the fairy-tale, where His Naked Majesty is marching through the streets with little to no clothing whatsoever, unless you count his crown as an article of clothing.</p><p>Taketomo renders the child's perspicuous observation as: </p><p>「でも王様は何も着ていらっしゃらないよ」<br><em>"Demo ousama wa nani mo kite irassharanai yo."</em><br>"But the King is not vested in any clothing, I say!"</p><p>Where the verb <em>kiru </em>(to wear) is here in its gerund with the reverential verb <em>irassharu </em>performing the negative tense thus "is not wearing anything." The choice for such an honorific suppletive verb sounds almost too eloquent for a child, hence "vested in clothing," rather than "wearing clothing," as the translation choice.</p><p>And similarly Oohata gives us:</p><p>「でも、なんにも着ていらっしゃらないよ。」<br><em>"Demo, nanni mo kite irassharanai yo"</em><br>"But he isn't vested in any clothes!"</p><p>With <em>irassharu</em> once more appearing in the negative and the question word <em>nani </em>is here doubled as <em>nanni </em>like a "whaat" or an elongated or enforced sense of surprise.</p><p>Thus we have taken care of these two decades and are now moving on to the last step in our analysis of the translations of the fairy-tale, wherewith we will also encounter Oohata's final translation.</p>

those astro-political questions are beyond the scope of this article.  returning to emperor palpatine, he is various referred to throughout the past and present media as  &quot;excellency&quot;, &quot;highness&quot; and &quot;majesty&quot;,  the former more proper for his former status as senator, the middlemost being either a flub or an insult from luke skywalker and the latter being the proper way to refer to an emperor.   he  is  also referred to as your excellency within the narrative frame of  star wars episode ii - attack of the clones , by people such as anakin skywalker, the later lord darth vader, where palpatine is &quot;elected&quot; the supreme chancellor of the galactic senate.  &quot;lord&quot; and &quot;lady&quot; and to that point also &quot;master&quot; are the most stable of the titles used within star wars, the former two being generic honorifics used for nobility or people of power and the latter for jedi/sith masters, in the sense of a teacher and their apprentice.  darth vader, whereof &quot;darth&quot; would one assume is the title assumed by a person when they become a sith and the other half being some sort of pseudo-ominous nickname, hence sidious from &quot;insidious&quot; and tyrannus from &quot; tyrannous .&quot; if you look at the earlier drafts for  episode iv - a new hope  and just take the film on itself, separate from the sequels and prequels, then it is revealed that &quot;darth&quot; is in fact the forename of the character, hence obi-wan kenobi calling him by this in the film - retroactively changed to be obi-wan reminding vader of how far he has fallen.  the very name &quot;darth vader&quot; stems from the phrase  &quot;dark water&quot;  and hearkens back to george lucas' cr">

Her office is that of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elective_monarchy">elected monarch</a> and as such she is deservant of the proper title as any other king or queen of a country would have, regardless of her inheriting the position or being elected for it.</p><p>One could posit that the Nabooians themselves are positively confused as to what is the right form of address to the Queen herself - hence only the Senator and a member of an intergalactic order of warrior-monks apparently knowing how to adhere to protocol.</p><p>All of them use "my lady" after she abdicates her position in favour of becoming a senator herself, thus earning the proper formal style of "Your Excellency," and on the very topic of Excellency, before we move on to old Sheev, we need address the discombobulating matter of titles of nobility and royalty within the Star Wars universe which is thrown about indiscriminately, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/untitled-5/">let us not get started on how an interpreter-robot can be human-cyborg relations.</a></p><p>Arch-Dukes, Barons, Bosses, Caliphs, Counts, Emirs, Emperors, Grand Viziers, Kings, Princes, Princesses, Queens, Viceroys and so on, all of these are actual real world titles and as such do have some sense of meaning to them, however they are thrown around as if given out at a grand galactic lottery for aristocrats. Dooku is the hereditary count of his home-world Serenno, hence Count Dooku, why the hell an entire planet constitutes a county boggles the mind. Counts were typically given land or area by virtue of a monarch granting them it, did Dooku's ancestors do any favours for any ancient rulers? Those astro-political questions are beyond the scope of this article.</p><p>Returning to Emperor Palpatine, he is various referred to throughout the past and present media as <a href="https://boards.theforce.net/threads/nobility-titles-and-naming-conventions.50027038/#post-52129197">"Excellency", "Highness" and "Majesty",</a> the former more proper for his former status as senator, the middlemost being either a flub or an insult from Luke Skywalker and the latter being the proper way to refer to an emperor. </p><p>He <em>is </em>also referred to as Your Excellency within the narrative frame of <em>Star Wars Episode II - Attack of the Clones</em>, by people such as Anakin Skywalker, the later Lord Darth Vader, where Palpatine is "elected" the Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Senate.</p><p>"Lord" and "lady" and to that point also "master" are the most stable of the titles used within Star Wars, the former two being generic honorifics used for nobility or people of power and the latter for Jedi/Sith masters, in the sense of a teacher and their apprentice.</p><p>Darth Vader, whereof "Darth" would one assume is the title assumed by a person when they become a Sith and the other half being some sort of pseudo-ominous nickname, hence Sidious from "insidious" and Tyrannus from "<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tyrannous">tyrannous</a>." If you look at the earlier drafts for <em>Episode IV - A New Hope </em>and just take the film on itself, separate from the sequels and prequels, then it is revealed that "Darth" is in fact the forename of the character, hence Obi-Wan Kenobi calling him by this in the film - retroactively changed to be Obi-Wan reminding Vader of how far he has fallen.</p><p>The very name "Darth Vader" stems from the phrase <a href="https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/28174/origin-of-darth-vaders-name/199222">"dark water"</a> and hearkens back to George Lucas' creative nomenclature when naming the characters in the story, going more by what sounds best rather than the meaning of the name. Only through the serendipity of Vader quasi-sounding like Germanic words for "father" and "darth" halfway looking like "dark" do we get what is later spuriously claimed to be the official etymology.</p><p>Vader is furthermore apparently derived from the name of <a href="https://screenrant.com/star-wars-darth-vader-dark-father-translation-myth/">Gary Vader</a>, one of Lucas' old acquaintances from his high school days - who purportedly bullied Lucas' younger self, hence it being an apt name for the main villain of the films.</p><p>So, all in all what did we learn?</p><p>It's a fantasy tale set in a galaxy far, far away and thinking overly much about the actual etymological, historical and real-life importance of concepts within the Star Wars universe will set it crumbling apart.</p><p>Presumably the titles are very much just an homage to the science fiction stories of old and especially the pulp fiction that George Lucas was fond of and created Star Wars as an homage to that golden era of weird adventure fiction, where you would slap an aristocratic title to an intergalactic villain and it would be nothing more than to suggest the ominous nature of them more than anything else.</p>

            <article id="emperors-new-clothes-comparison-1924-1929" class="gh-post" data-search-content=" thus we enter a new decade of translations and a new round of analyses that either have the emperor of the story be demoted to mere king or have him keep his empire.  we thus acquaint ourselves with three new translations, this time by two translators: kusuyama masao's two versions from the 1920s (one being also from 1924), whereof one of these being used as the official h. c. andersen tourist-centre's translation into japanese, and mitaku fusako's translation from 1929.  i was unable to date the latest of kusuyama's translations, unfortunately, for chronologically it seems to be from a few years later than his first one, if the fact that it was used in a later 1965 release is taken into consideration.  it is worth noting that kusuyama's two versions differ significantly in terms of linguistic style and how he renders the titles and terms of the story, where it seems that the latter of the translations have more had a focus on gearing it towards a younger audience and turning down some of the otherwise difficult words.   the emperor:   kusuyama's oldest translation gives the emperor's title as  tenshi-sama  (天子さま, &quot;lord child of heaven&quot;), as noted before the ancient term for the chinese emperor being viewed as a manner of divine monarch. he and mitaka fusako however opt for the much more common  koutei  (皇帝), that has less an archaic sound and corresponds to the modern japanese word for non-japanese emperors - the word itself stemming ultimately from the title of the first emperor of china.  already one can sense a change in mood from kusuyama in terms of rendering the imperial title of office in a less arcane light and in a more modern term, also so that the younger readership may be able to follow and understand the action in the story itself much better.  how does this monarch then act in these three versions?  kusuyama's initial translation gives us these first lines from the emperor:  「なるほどそれは調法な着物だな。わたしがそれを着れば、この國で誰が身分に相應しない人物であるか見つけ出すことも出来るし、利口と馬鹿の見わけもつくわけだ。よし、さっそくその織物を織らせることにしよう。」   &quot;naruhodo sore wa chouhou na kimono dana. watashi ga sore wo kireba, kono kuni ga jibun ni fusuwashinai jinbutsu dearu mitsukedashu koto mo dekiru shi, rikou to baka no miwake mo tsukuwakeda. yoshi, sassoku sono orimono wo oraseru koto ni shiyou.&quot;   &quot;i see, that is a most useful thing, indeed. if i were to wear such a thing, then i would be able to locate who in my kingdom are unfit personages, thus locating the bright from the stupid. yes! i shall right away have them weave me this textile!&quot;   watashi , the gender-neutral if aloof, in fiction, pronoun is used for his self-reference. not  chin  nor  yo , which would correspond to a more regal sound of diction. his speech patterns are otherwise standard masculine language - such as is witnessed by the masculine emphatic particle  na .  his subsequent translation renders this line as:  「なるほど、それは大した着物だな。」 と、皇帝はかんがえました。 「それをおれが着れば、いったいこの國のどの役人が、つとめにむかないやくざものであるか分るし、りこうものとばかもののみわけもつくわけだ。よし、さっそく、その着物をおらせることにしよう。」   &quot;naruhodo, sore wa taishita kimono dana.&quot; to, koutei wa kangaemashita. &quot;sore wo ore ga kireba, ittai kono kuni no dono yakunin ga, tsutome ni mukanai yakuzamono de aru wakarushi, rikoumono to bakamono no mi wake mo tsuku wake da. yoshi, sassoku, sono kimono wo oraseru koto ni shiyou.&quot;   &quot;i see, that is quite formidable clothing.&quot; thought the emperor to himself. &quot;if i wore this, then i would know who on earth in my kingdom are ne'er-do-wells, who're the clever and who are idiots. yes, i will right away have them make me this textile.&quot;  quite a prominent switch of mood, he goes from  watashi  in the initial translation to straight up  ore , the rough informal male first person pronoun, thus giving him a much more less-stately aura, but the diction is still old-fashioned, i.e.  no mi , &quot;for the sake of&quot;, which is more formal way of expression intention.  yakuzamono  does not necessarily here refer to criminals as much as just ruffians or ne'er-do-wells, it is nevertheless related to the homophone.  the term translated as &quot;bright&quot; and &quot;clever&quot; in the above quotes is literally using  rikou  (利口) as its basis. literally consisting of kanji meaning &quot;profit&quot; and &quot;mouth&quot; (hence, &quot;to speak&quot;) it can variously mean &quot;well-behaved,&quot; &quot;shrewd&quot; or even &quot;obedient&quot;; much fittingly and literally it also means &quot;to be good with words,&quot; but its multivalent nature means that context dictates the precise meaning and since it is contrasted to  baka  (ばか), &quot;fool/idiot&quot;, i thought the choice of &quot;bright&quot;/&quot;clever&quot; fitting.  another thing that is worth of note is that in kusuyama's final translation,  rikou  is spelled in hiragana (りこう), i.e. one of the two kana syllabary, the other being katakana, hence it is easier for a younger reader to read the word rather than the kanji itself, which may be difficult.  mitaku gives us:  『それはきっと結構な着物であらう。』と、皇帝はお考へになりました。 『もし、朕がそれを着たら、わが國の如何なる人間が、その職に適してゐるかが分るし、また賢い者と愚か者との區別もつかう、さうだ。その織物をすゞと織らせねばならぬ。』   &quot;sore wa kitto kekkou na kimono de arou.&quot; to, koutei wa">

We verily <em>must</em> have that textile produced for Us!"</p><p>If Kusuyama was modern and contemporary in his tone then Mitaku gives us an Emperor who speaks like a monarch of the ancient past, replete with <em>chin, </em>traditionally rendered akin to the Royal We in English, but more correctly being a first-person singular pronoun reserved for royals, that does not connote any grammatical plurality. He also used <em>wagakuni </em>(我が國, "Our Country"), which is highly formal, but fitting with his style of speech, where he also see the archaic negation <em>nu</em> used in <em>orasenebanaranu </em>("it must be weaved") versus that of modern <em>orasenebanaranai, </em>where <em>nai</em> is the negation.</p><p>The narrator also uses the <em>o-ninaru</em> construction for the Emperor's thinking or contemplation, thus <em>kangaeta </em>(thought) becomes <em>okangaeninarimasita</em> (the sir/madam thought), this being the utmost polite <em>sonkeigo</em> manner of rendering the verb, literally, "most honourably became the thought" thus removing the agency from the sentence, as is part of the usual strategy of politeness through distancing of the grammatical person or subject.</p><p><strong>The Minister:</strong></p><p>The old and trustworthy minister is across the board rendered as <em>daijin </em>(大臣, "cabinet minister"), which will set the trend for subsequent translations up to our days.</p><p>Speech-wise, we see Kusuyama in the first translation render the minister as such:</p><p>でも大臣はかう思ひました。「やれやれ、おれはそんなにばかなのかなあ。おれはさうは思はなかった。誰きもそれがわかる筈はあるまい。おれは大臣の職に相應しない人間なのかな。いや、おれには織物が見えなかったなどと人にいってはなるまいぞ。」</p><p><em>Demo daijin ha kou omoimashita. "Yare yare, ore wa sonnani baka no kanaa. Ore wa sou wa omowanakatta. Dare kimo sore ga wakaru hazu wa arumai. Ore wa daijin no shoku ni fusuwashinai ningen nano kana. Iya, ore ni wa orimono ga mienakatta nado hito ni itte wa narumai zo."</em></p><p>However, the cabinet minister thought to himself. "Damn it, am I really such an idiot. I can't have thought so. No one shall know the gist of this. That I am a man, who is unfit for the office of Cabinet Minister. No, I will not tell anyone at all that I can't see the textile."</p><p>Two things of note, he uses <em>ore </em>and uses the alternate if formal volitional negative <em>-mai</em> ("will not") for <em>arumai </em>(will not be) and <em>narumai </em>(will not become). In his later translation the Minister has a similar manner of speaking, but initially uses <em>washi</em>, primarily used as the generic geriatric pronoun, before switching to <em>ore </em>in his internal monologue.</p><p>Mitaku gives us this Minister,</p><p>『それは大變だ！　私はそんなに馬鹿なのかしら。今までさうとは思ってゐなかったか。しかし、この事は誰にも知らせたくない。それとも、私は自分の役目に適してゐないのか知ら。さうだ、織物が見えなかったなどとは、誰にも話さない事にしよう。』と、大臣は考へました。<br><br><em>"Sore wa taihen da! Washi wa sonna ni baka na no kashira. Ima made sou to wa omotte inakatta. Shikashi, kono koto wa dare ni mo shirasetakunai. Soretomo, washi wa jibun no yakume ni tekishite inai no kashira. Souda, orimono ga mienakatta nado to wa, dare ni mo hanasanai koto ni shiyou." to daijin wa kangaemashita.</em></p><p>"This is most dreadful! Am I forsooth a fool? I have not thought myself as such up until now. But, no one shall know of this. Otherwise I shan't be worthy of my station. Yea, I to say that I cannot see the textile is something I shan't!" thought the cabinet minister to himself.</p><p>He uses <em>washi, </em>written with the character for <em>watashi</em> - thus denoting a properness, but it's also derived from said pronoun - and <em>kashira, </em>an emphatic particle that denotes doubt, akin to our question-mark, but is otherwise part of modern standard female language. Otherwise he speaks standard male language, that lacks the formal <em>-mai</em>  negative volitional forms.</p><p><strong>The Swindlers:</strong></p><p>Kusuyama and Mitaku calls them <em>sagishi </em>(詐欺師, "imposters; swindlers") in their respective translations, but Kusuyama switches to <em>petenshi </em>(ぺてん師), which whilst it has the same meaning is written purely in hiragana and thus has more of a colloquial feel to it - furthermore Wiktionary lists it with the meaning of "quack/charlatan," though the former denotes a fake medical expert and the latter more closely resembles that of the pair's role in the story.</p><p>Who then can be the most oleaginous of the three?</p><p>(The fictitious frauds from the Andersen fairy-tale, not the translators, mind you!)</p><p> Let us compare the scene where the Swindlers ask whether or not His Imperial Majesty wishes to undress and try the non-existent clothes on:</p><p>First version:</p><p>『陛下にはお召物をおぬきあそばしますか。さういたしましたら、あの大姿見の前で新調のお召物をお着せまうすでござりませう。』</p><p><em>"Heika ni wa omeshimono wo onukiasobashimasuka. Sou itashimashitara, ano oosugatami no mae de shinchou no omeshimono wo okisemousu de gozaimashou"</em></p><p>"Does Your Majesty would please to undress His garbs! If we may do so, then if only Your Majesty would place Your Majesty before the grand mirror and try the new clothes on"</p><p>Second version:</p><p>「陛下にはなにとぞお召物をおとりあそばしますよう。」<br>と、ぺてん師どもはいいました。<br>「そういたしましたら、あの大姿見のまえで、ご新調のお召物をおつけ申しあげますでございましょう。」<br><br><em>"Heika ni wa nanitozo omeshimono wo otoriasobashimasuyou."<br>to, petenshi domo wa iimashita.<br>"Sou itashimashitara, ano oosugatami no mae de, shinchou no omeshimono wo otsukemoushiagemasu de gozaimashou"</em></p><p>"We beg most humbly that Your Majesty be kind to deign to wear these robes."<br>said the charlatans.<br>"If we may then, with Your Majesty in front of the grand mirror, most graciously deign to try on the new garbs, we most sincerely request, liege!"</p><p>Both versions uses the <em>kenjougo, </em>humble register, auxiliary verb <em>mousu </em>(first translation) and <em>moushiageru </em>(final translation), both meaning "to state, to utter, to perform," in conjunction with their respective verbs.</p><p>Mitaku's tailor-swindlers speak thus:</p><p>『陛下、どうそお召物をお脱き下さいますやうに。私どもは、あの大きな鏡の前で、新しいお召物をお着せ申します。』</p><p><em>"Heika, douzo omeshimono wo onukikudasaimasuyouni.

We humble fellows may then be able to dress Your Majesty, provided Your Majesty is graciously in front of the mirror."</p><p><em>Watakushi-domo</em>, the most self-deprecating first person plural form is used along with the archaic <em>-mousu </em>humble auxiliary verb as seen in Kusuyama's example. It is also worth noting that the swindlers use <em>kudasaimasu</em>, the full polite form of <em>kudasaru, </em>"to bestow upon," usually only seen in its imperative mode <em>kudasai </em>(if [you would} please deign) and occasionally in its dictionary form, <em>kudasaru</em>.</p><p>Thus all three speak in highly decorous language.</p><p>When they are dubbed, the Emperor grants them, in Kusuyama's two translations, the title(s) of :</p><p>First translation:  <em>Teishitsuhataorishi </em>(帝室機織師, "Weaving Masters of the Imperial Household")<br>Final translation: <em>Orimonokizoku </em>織り物貴族 (Weaving Noblemen) </p><p>One being a rather grandiloquent title and the other a mere statement if approximation of the originals <em>væverjunker</em>. </p><p>Mitaku renders the title of nobility as: <em>Kyuuchuuorimonoshi </em>(宮中織物師, "Weaving Masters for the Imperial Court"), which hits the semantics of her predecessor and is redolent of the pomposity of Andersen's original title that literally has "væver" (weaver) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junker">"junker".</a> The latter being an already well known title of lesser nobility during Andersen's time.</p><p><strong>"He is wearing no clothes!"</strong></p><p>The pivotal moment when His Majesty's true vanity is revealed during the Imperial Parade is rendered thus in the three respective versions:<br><br>Kusuyama:<br>First:<br>「でもあの人なんにも着てゐないや。」<br><em>"Demo ano hito nanni mo kite inai ya"</em><br>"But he isn't wearin' anything at all!"<br><br>Final:<br>「やあ、あのいと、なんに着ていないや。」<br><em>"Yaa, anoito, nanni kite inai ya"</em><br>"Hey! That person isn't wearin' anythin' at all!"</p><p>Mitaku:<br>『陛下は何も着てゐないぢゃないか。』<br><em>"Heika wa nani mo kite nai janai ka"</em><br>"He's not wearing anything at all, is he?"</p><p>Thus all three versions rendered in varying degrees of colloquial speech has the child marking the Emperor's obvious falling for the sartorial frauds.</p>

            <article id="translated-titles" class="gh-post" data-search-content=" this article was originally going to be about the pronoun  kikou  (貴公), but research led me to a much deeper topic, namely that of how one translates and even conversely render other titles from one language to the other. today we shall be looking at the title of  duke , namely its usage in japanese titles of nobility, pronouns and honorifics.   the title:   the kanji 公 refers to the ancient title of administrative nobility of the zhou dynasty, namely the  gong.  it was considered the pinnacle of the hierarchy of chinese nobility during the 1000s to the 700s bce, it switched in significance over the dynasties, but nevertheless remained a high degree of status.  how then, do japanese translators treat its supposed western counterpart,  duke  or more specifically  dux  in the latin original form. to see this we must take one of the oldest english attestations of the title, as appended to the style of a monarch, namely john i, or in latin johannes i, in the preface to the magna carta of 1215:  johannes del gracia rex anglie, dominus hibernie, dux normannie, aquitannie et comes andegravie  &quot;john, by the grace of god, the king of england, the lord of ireland, duke of normandy and aquitaine and the count of anjou.&quot;  straight forward enough and par the course for monarch's introductory panoply of titles.  dux in its original context referred in roman times to the army-leaders, literally derived from the latin  duco  (&quot;i lead&quot;), thus literally being those who directed the armies on behalf of the emperor of rome.  the anglo-saxons used the the term to refer to the predecessor to the modern title of nobility, whereof it referred to the chiefs of war-bands - william the conqueror was referred to initially as a  earl , but later on within a few hundred years became  duc , both in the anglo saxon chronicles of 1066 - 1129 and the royal gloucester chronicle from 1297, though this bordered on the middle english period.  then it appears, apropos, in its middle english guise as  dux  - oed cites its earliest appearances as in  layamon 's 1275 arthurian epic   brut   - and up until the wycliffe bible from 1380, do we finally see its emergence in the form  duk , only one step away from the modern spelling of  duke -  albeit in the above middle english attestations is it used in the loose sense of &quot;a leader; a leader of an army, a captain or general; a chief, ruler. (oed).&quot; noted by oed as obsolete in our times. the reference to the original roman military title only occurs much later in the 1650s.  returning to the magna carta, in the  eikoku kenpou  (英國憲法, &quot;the constitution of the united kingdom&quot;) by sabotani zenshirou (坪谷善四郎) from 1888, the aforesaid translator renders the introduction as this:  神明ノ恵愛テ受ケタル英國皇帝兼アイルランド王ノルマン及ビアックイタイン公アンヂュー伯ジョン   shinmei no keiai te uketaru eikoku koutei ken airurando ou noruman oyobi akkuitain kou anjû haku jon   &quot;john, by the grace of god, emperor of great britain, prince of ireland, duke of normandy and aquitaine and earl of anjou.&quot;  literally that he is the  kou  (公) of &quot;normandy and aquitaine&quot;, and furthermore perhaps surprisingly  koutei  (皇帝, &quot;emperor&quot;) of &quot;great britain&quot; by the  keiai  (恵愛, &quot;charity, compassionate love&quot;), which is quite  a rare term , so much so that i had to look it up in the more sizeable online dictionaries. that he is  ou  (王) of ireland, can also be translated as &quot;king/ruler/lord&quot;, though &quot;prince&quot; is used here as a catch-all for them, in the sense of feudal lord rather than traditional sense of the son of a king.   kou  is thus used to translate part of  dux,  which by the time of john i's reign referred to the ancestral  duchy of aquitaine .   the honorific:   returning back to the ancient chinese title of nobility, it was used as such also in the name of gods, such as the &quot;thunder duke,&quot;   lei gung  , or in japanese  raikou,  who ranks as the chinese god of thunder and   the title was used in japan as a lordly honorific with a loose sense of the addressee having an actual position of power or have had it in the past thus earning them the respect. its usage arose and persisted during the early 1100s and continued, albeit nowadays it is highly archaic and only roams the landscape of theatre and fiction.  such as:  謙信公！　やはりこの世界にあっても……。 我ら上杉が貫くべきは「義」でしょうか？   kenshin-kou! yahari kono sekai ni atte mo ... ...  warera uesugi ga tsuranku beki wa &quot;gi&quot; de shou ka?   &quot;lord kenshin! i knew that you too would be in this world...... we, the uesugi, shall also stick to our &quot;justice&quot;, shan't we?&quot;  (musou orochi 2 ultimate, koei-tecmo)   as seen here  uesugi kenshin , based off the same historical japanese warlord, from his depiction in the action game   musou orochi 2 ultimate  , is talked to by one of his loyal retainers  naoe kanetsugu  upon realising that they have been teleported to a mystical world. historically it would not have been unfeasible for retainers to refer to their liege-lord in such a way as naoe does towards uesugi.  the pronoun is spelled with the kanji 貴公, ">

The reference to the original Roman military title only occurs much later in the 1650s.</p><p>Returning to the Magna Carta, in the <em>Eikoku Kenpou </em>(英國憲法, "The Constitution of the United Kingdom") by Sabotani Zenshirou (坪谷善四郎) from 1888, the aforesaid translator renders the introduction as this:</p><p>神明ノ恵愛テ受ケタル英國皇帝兼アイルランド王ノルマン及ビアックイタイン公アンヂュー伯ジョン</p><p><em>Shinmei no keiai te uketaru eikoku koutei ken Airurando ou Noruman oyobi Akkuitain kou Anjû haku Jon</em></p><p>"John, by the Grace of God, Emperor of Great Britain, Prince of Ireland, Duke of Normandy and Aquitaine and Earl of Anjou."</p><p>Literally that he is the <em>kou </em>(公) of "Normandy and Aquitaine", and furthermore perhaps surprisingly <em>koutei </em>(皇帝, "emperor") of "Great Britain" by the <em>keiai </em>(恵愛, "charity, compassionate love"), which is quite <a href="https://kotobank.jp/word/%E6%81%B5%E6%84%9B-488128">a rare term</a>, so much so that I had to look it up in the more sizeable online dictionaries. That he is <em>ou </em>(王) of Ireland, can also be translated as "King/Ruler/Lord", though "Prince" is used here as a catch-all for them, in the sense of feudal lord rather than traditional sense of the son of a king.</p><p><em>Kou </em>is thus used to translate part of <em>dux, </em>which by the time of John I's reign referred to the ancestral <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Aquitaine">duchy of Aquitaine</a>.</p><p><strong>The Honorific:</strong></p><p>Returning back to the ancient Chinese title of nobility, it was used as such also in the name of gods, such as the "Thunder Duke," <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leigong"><em>Lei Gung</em></a>, or in Japanese <em>Raikou, </em>who ranks as the Chinese god of thunder and </p><p>The title was used in Japan as a lordly honorific with a loose sense of the addressee having an actual position of power or have had it in the past thus earning them the respect. Its usage arose and persisted during the early 1100s and continued, albeit nowadays it is highly archaic and only roams the landscape of theatre and fiction.</p><p>Such as:</p><p>謙信公！　やはりこの世界にあっても……。<br>我ら上杉が貫くべきは「義」でしょうか？<br><br><em>Kenshin-kou! Yahari kono sekai ni atte mo ... ... <br>Warera Uesugi ga tsuranku beki wa "gi" de shou ka?</em><br><br>"Lord Kenshin! I knew that you too would be in this world......<br>We, the Uesugi, shall also stick to our "Justice", shan't we?"<br><em>(Musou Orochi 2 Ultimate, KOEI-Tecmo)</em></p><p>As seen here <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uesugi_Kenshin">Uesugi Kenshin</a>, based off the same historical Japanese warlord, from his depiction in the action game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warriors_Orochi_3"><em>Musou Orochi 2 Ultimate</em></a>, is talked to by one of his loyal retainers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naoe_Kanetsugu">Naoe Kanetsugu</a> upon realising that they have been teleported to a mystical world. Historically it would not have been unfeasible for retainers to refer to their liege-lord in such a way as Naoe does towards Uesugi.</p><p>The pronoun is spelled with the kanji 貴公, literally "honourable duke," fitting in with other pronouns such as <em>kikun</em> (貴君, "honourable prince"), though this arose in part from confusing the pronunciation of <em>kihou </em>(貴方), an older pronunciation for <em>anata. </em>Nevertheless it belongs to the category of polite pronouns that use quasi-noble appellation in terms of equal to higher respect. The words <em>kei </em>(卿, "lord") and <em>kimi </em>(君, "prince") also belong to this category, though the latter has become a regular informal second person pronoun and the former an archaic formal second person pronoun.</p><p>Thus, we came from the imperial and royal courts of China and Europe to those of Japan and then straight back to video games- which is what I cover the most here, though I will perhaps be delving more into history in the future.</p>

There is also <em>mashimasu</em>, an honorific existential verb of similar exaltation as <em>ohoshimasu</em> and also of the same ancient age, here applied to Emperor's owning the Imperial city.</p><p>Ueda also uses the archaic if formal causative passive tense such as seen in <em>shutsugyo serareta</em> (出御せられた, "the Emperor made his entrance"), applying said respectful verbal form to the honorific noun <em>shutsugyo </em>(出御, "an Emperor's arrival," lit. most honourable entrance"), though 御 has also the ancient Chinese meaning of "to govern" and "Imperial."</p><p>Kondo gives us:</p><p>『其の反物こそ天下一の重寳ぢゃ、朕が其れを上衣に仕立てさせて着てゐれば、其れの見えると見れないで、臣下等の賢愚が容易に識分けらるる道理、これは早速其の者共に命じて一反織らせずばなるまい』<br><br><em>"Sono tanmono koso tenkaichi no chouhou ja, chin ga sore wo uwagi ni shitate sase te kite ireba, sore no mieeru to mirenai te, shinkara no kengu ga youi ni iwakeraruru douri, kore wa sassoku sono monodomo ni meijite ittan orasezuba narumai."</em></p><p>"Such fabric must be the most precious of treasures in the entire world, if We were to wear such a coat then we should be able by reason of this, to ascertain with the greatest ease the wise from the foolish of Our retainers. We shall decree it at once to that these weaver fellows must oblige to weave for Us!"</p><p>There's <em>tenkaichi </em>(天下一, "the best in the world," lit. "number one under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianxia">the heavens</a>.") and several archaic traits that in the same vein as Ueda's that render his speech appropriate for an elderly monarch. He uses the term <em>chouhou </em>(重寳) which can also mean "convenience" as well as literally "precious treasure", the word is normally spelled 重宝 in modern orthography, using the simplified variant of the latter meaning "treasure." Therefore there may be a pun intended in how the clothes are "treasures", but also a useful "measure/convenience" in how to gauge the competence of his retainers.</p><p><strong>The Old Minister:</strong></p><p>Wadagaki renders his title as <em>Daijin </em>(大臣, "Cabinet Minister"), Ueda gives <em>Saishou </em>(宰相, "Prime Minister") and Kondou gives the full version of the former title, <em>Souri Daijin </em>(總理大臣, lit. "Over-Presiding Grand Minister", also "Premier"). which whilst written 総理大臣 in modern Japanese, is the usual full title of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Japan">the Prime Minister of Japan</a>. </p><p>Wadagaki has the Minister be positively reticent with no dialogue whatsoever, whereas Ueda and Kondou have him much more loquacious.</p><p>Both Ueda and Kondou have the Minister refer to himself with <em>washi</em>, the standard geriatric pronoun, but Ueda uses the kanji 私, the etymon for the pronoun, ordinarily read as <em>watashi </em>and more formally <em>watakushi</em>, with its overtones of formality and politeness, and Kondou uses 俺, read as <em>ore</em> in regular circumstances, with itself being the informal assertive male pronoun. Thus, Ueda has him with the underscoring sense of being a proper and prim state-official and Kondou renders him merely a flustered regular bloke.</p><p>He does change his pronoun in Kondou's version when declaring that he shall deliver the message to the Emperor concerning that the clothes are up to His Majesty's wishes:</p><p>『模様と云ひ色合ひ、申分のない上々の出来ぢゃ、陛下は拙者が此の旨奏上したら、嘸御満足な事であらうと思ふ。』</p><p><em>"Moyou to ii to iroai, moushibun no nai joujou no deki ja, heika wa sessha ga kono mune soujou shitara, sazo gomanzoku na koto de arou to omou."</em></p><p>"The patterns and the colours are the best of the best that one simply cannot criticise them. This humble one shall at once convey the propitious news to His Majesty. It is most certain that His Majesty shall be fully satisfied."</p><p>He uses the self-deprecating and archaic pronoun <em>sessha </em>(拙者, lit. "this clumsy person"), which most people will probably associate with samurai films where the samurai use this pronoun as their go-to pronoun. It stands in sharp contrast to his <em>washi</em> using the kanji for <em>ore</em>, that is by far the most informal pronoun with no shades of modesty.</p><p>Ueda renders the Minister's speech as:</p><p>『私は此織物には實に感服して居るから、その旨を必ず陛下へ奏上に及ばう。』<br><br><em>"Washi wa kono orimono ni wa jitsu ni kanpuku shite oru kara, sono mune wo kanarazu heika he soujou ni oyobou."</em><br><br>"I shall most definitely  convey to His Majesty that these textiles are most worthy of admiration."</p><p>Less self-deprecation than in Kondou's version, that is fairy-tale courtiers for you.</p><p><strong>The Swindlers:</strong></p><p>Rendering this into a simple overview:</p><p>Wadagaki - <em>hataori </em>(織工, "weaver")<br>Wadagaki does not directly call them swindlers merely describing them by their profession, here giving the word <em>shokkou </em>("weaver") the non-standard pronunciation <em>hataori</em>, whilst still literally meaning "weaver," is written 機織, composed of "loom" and "weaving," and <em>shokkou</em> with "weaving" and "worker," hence presumably to layer two common words for the profession, but highlighting with the kanji their sly industriousness, as 工 can also mean "craft/means/idea" when used on its own and pronounced <em>takumi</em>.</p><p>Ueda - <em>sagishi </em>(詐欺師, "swindler/impostor")<br>Literally, "master of fraud/swindling". A rather ordinary word for "swindler," but the suffix <em>shi</em> tends to indicate an expert within their field of work.</p><p>Kondou <em>- sagishi </em>(欺僞師, "master of cheating and lies")<br>As noted above <em>sagishi </em>is the regular word for "swindler," and here Kondou applies an apparent self-made compound with this reading, literally referring to their mendacious and deceptive mastery, but giving it a much more common pronunciation, essentially adding an extra nuance of meaning to the word.</p><p>How do they talk? As in the previous versions, smoke-blowing, posterior-kissing and slippery to the point that the imperial court are all too pleased. I would say this, but Wadagaki once more is economic with the language can simply cuts off their <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/blandiloquence">blandiloquence</a> and promptly just have them act as silent agents of the King's birthday-gear procession.</p><p>Ueda and Kondou are thankfully much more generous in this regard, where two examples from each shall suffice:</p><p>Ueda:<br>『承はって恐悦至極に存じまする』<br><em>"Uketamawatte kyouetsushigoku ni zonjimasu</em>"<br>"We humbly express our most sincere rapture at this, Sir."</p><p><em>Uketamawaru</em> is of high antiquity and also formality, meaning "to humbly acquiesce/express" this is coupled with its fellow ancient verb <em>zonjiru</em> ("to humbly have the opinion"), thus they are right from the start kissing His Excellency's arse.</p><p>『陛下、何卒御召物を御脱ぎ下されまするやうに、さすれば此大鏡の前にて御新調の御服を御着せ申すでござりまする。』<br><em>"Heika, nanitozo omeshimono wo onugi kudasaremasu youni, sasureba kono ookagami no mae ni te goshinchou no gyofuku wo okisemousu de gozarimasuru."</em><br>"Your Majesty, pray if Your Majesty would deign to declothe, that we then would be able to garb Your Majesty most reverently in front of the mirror in the Imperial Robes."</p><p>More, more and even more! <em>Nanitozo </em>(pray/please), <em>kudasaremasuru, </em>the archaic and honorific form of <em>kudasaru </em>(to bestow, to please do), <em>gyofuku</em> ("the Emperor's clothes"), using the archaic honorific <em>gyo-, </em>rounding it all off with <em>okisemousu </em>and <em>gozarimasuru</em>, whereof the former uses <em>mousu</em> in its archaic sense as a humble auxiliary verb, "to do/to ask of," and the latter a more decorous form of <em>gozaimasu</em> ("to honourably be").</p><p>Kondou:</p><p>『何とお役人さま！　私共が腕に縒リをかけて致す仕事の事ですから、是非の御批評を伺ひたいので御座ります。』<br><em>"Nani wo oyakunin-sama! Watakushidomo ga ude ni yori wo kakete itasu shigoto no koto desukara, zehi no gohihyou wo ukagaitai no de gozarimasu."</em><br>"Ah, what is the matter, Lord Minister? Since we humble people have put all our might and main into this task, we would most respectfully ask of your most honourable review!" </p><p>Good old <em>watakushidomo, </em>the humble first person plural, is present, as is the humble verbs <em>itasu </em>("to humbly do") and <em>ukagai </em>("to humbly enquire").</p><p>『私共二人が此の大鏡の前で、唯今仕立て上った計りのお具合よくお着せ申しませう』<br><em>"Watakushidomo futari no ookagami no mae de, tadaima shitate agatte hakari no oguai yoku okisemoushimashou."</em><br>"Us two humble people most politely request that Your Majesty would go undress before the grand mirror, that we then take the necessary measurements for Your Majesty's condition, that we garb Your Majesty."</p><p>Nothing that has not been mentioned before, as Ueda, they use the <em>okisemousu</em> construction to express the request of wanting most humbly to take the measurements and dress the Emperor.</p><p>All three of the translators - when the Emperor accolades them with court titles - render their noble titles of <em>væverjunker </em>(weaver-knight):</p><p>Wadagaki: <em>gotenfuhataori </em>(御殿付機織, "Weaver to the Royal Court")<br>Ueda: <em>goyouorimonoshi </em>(御用織物師, "Official Textile Master")<br>Kondou: <em>teishitsuorimono'i'in </em>(帝室織物委員, "Committee Member of the Imperial Household’s Weavers")</p><p>Kondou takes the court title and gives it a magnanimous dose of Imperial grandiloquence. Not only are they weavers of the Imperial Court or Household, but they are prominent members of the official committee, that therefore hints towards His Majesty wanting to hire more weavers of varying degrees of morality.

                    <p>After having analysed Watanabe and Takahashi's translations we shall proceed a decade forward (or so), and tackle those of Nagura Jirou (1907) and Kimura Shoshuu (1908), whose versions differ quite significantly and continue in the vein of Takahashi when it comes to applying distinct nuances of personality to the cast and Andersen's trademark polite wit in the narration.</p><p><strong>The Emperor (or, rather, the demoted King):</strong></p><p>Most tellingly Nagura and Kimura both render the Emperor's title into <em>ousama </em>(王様, "king", lit. "Lord King"), although Nagura at one point has the King pondering if he is worth being a <em>teiou </em>(帝王, "sovereign, emperor") - albeit not the standard word for "emperor."</p><p>His Majesty's manner of speaking varies depending on the state of mind that the monarch is in in Nagura's translation, going from <em>watashi </em>(私), to the far more regal <em>chin </em>(朕) and <em>yo</em> (余), whereof the former was and still is heavily associated with Chinese and Japanese emperors - treated as the official majestic plural. Kimura merely has him use the masculine, informal and assertive <em>ore </em>(己), albeit written with a far more archaic character meaning "self," <em>onore</em>. Both nevertheless use the speech patterns of an elderly monarch, i.e. notably using the copula <em>ja </em>(ぢゃ), the existential verb <em>oru</em> (おる・居る) and the emphatic particle <em>wai </em>(わい) - though these three example also fits the generic elderly sociolect that you see in popular culture, key-features themselves of the Hiroshima dialect.</p><p>Nagura's translation takes the form of a bilingual edition where the Japanese text faces an English one that Nagura then proceeds to gloss and offers his own translation. Kimura however is straight up a standard translation in that regard.</p><p>Nagura's translation had me initially fearing that not all of the story would have been translated owing to his fragmenting approach towards it, but my fears were assuaged when I discovered that this was not the case. His approach is nevertheless far closer to the English translation offered at hand, which in turn takes one or two liberties with H. C. Andersen's original source text, but is overall itself faithful.</p><p>Nagura has the King - in this version - use three pronouns on different occasions:</p><p>『私は皆無見えない。こりゃ唯事でない。自分は馬鹿なのか知ら。（それとも）帝王に適しないのか。さうあっては我身に取って二つとない大恐慌。』</p><p><em>"Watashi wa kaimu mienai. Korya tadagoto de nai. Jibun wa baka nano kashira. (Sore tomo) teiou ni tekishinai no ka. Sou atte wa wagami ni totte futatsu to nai daikyoukou."</em></p><p>"I can't see bugger all! This isn't something trivial. I wonder if I'm an idiot? Or, am I unfit for the office of sovereign? This is the most scary thing that has befallen <em>moi!</em>"</p><p>Note that I use <em>moi</em> as a translation of <em>wagami </em>(我身, "myself personally") for the sake of nuance and flair.</p><p>Here the King, in an inner self-monologue, exposes his fears and refers to himself with <em>watashi</em>, a mature if aloof first-person pronoun that is nevertheless far more humble than his later regal self-references. </p><p>He also uses <em>kashira </em>(か知ら, "I do wonder")<em>, </em>which at the time and still in some dialects is gender-neutral.</p><p>『アア、見事なもの、朕の満足之れに過ぎない。』</p><p><em>"Aa, migoto na mono, chin no manzoku kore ni suginai"</em></p><p>"Ah, a magnificent thing! This, by far, surpasses Our expectations!"</p><p>Here appears <em>chin </em>(朕, "We, the monarch/emperor"), famously used by Chinese and Japanese emperors of old - itself an Old Chinese pronoun originally used by most, but later on chiefly by emperors. This mirrors the English translation offered above, "It has Our most gracious approval," thus prompting Nagura to translate this with <em>chin</em> as the mode of self-reference, over His Majesty's usual <em>watashi</em>, here communicating that he is trying to regain his usual royal self-composure.</p><p>『余が服装如何にもよく似合ふ、ではないか』</p><p><em>"Yo ga fukusou ikani mo yoku niau, de wa nai ka"</em></p><p>"Do these garments verily not fit well upon one as I, no?"</p><p>The more lordly <em>yo </em>appears two times, in the text, both in instances where the King is pleased with the delusions of the clothes. Whilst not as imperial as <em>chin</em>, it nevertheless is an oratory pronoun used by real-life nobility and in fiction has been used in the translation of Emperor Palpatine's dialogue.</p><p>Thus like a peaking diagram, the King starts with regular <em>watashi, </em>reaches the sovereign climax with <em>chin </em>and then slumps to the stately if less imposing <em>yo.</em></p><p>His <em>watashi </em>could alternatively, due to the lack of furigana, be read as <em>washi</em> thus truly turning him into an elderly monarch becoming bothered, shaken in his royal self-confidence in regards to these Swindler's and their fantastical cloth.</p><p>His mode style is however unflinchingly according to formalia: </p><p><em>heika </em>(陛下, "Your Majesty")</p><p>The usual style for monarchs (kings/queens and emperors/empresses), literally meaning "below the throne," and referring in ancient times to the in-between courtier who would transmit messages to the Throne personally since commoners had little right to face the exalted presence of a monarch. Similarly, in the Takahashi version he was referred to with <em>denka </em>(殿下, "Your Highness", lit. "below the palace [halls]"), referring to the courtier this time outside of the palace rather than the throne - presumably sentiments were still that <em>heika </em>as a style befitted actual real-life monarchs? I cannot know, unfortunately, at this moment. Nevertheless, the last in the line of styles - for the sake of clear explanation - is <em>kakka </em>(閣下, "Your Excellency" or "Your Lordship/Ladyship", lit. "bellow the palace/tower") moving as far as possible away from the regal presence and giving the furthest courtier the duty of relaying messages.</p><p>Kimura tackles His Majesty with:</p><p>『己（おれ）の目には何も見えやしない、して見ると己は馬鹿かも知れない、之れは何にしても困った言に成った』とお思いでしたが、(...) </p><p><em>"Ore no me ni wa nani mo mieyashinai, shite miru to ore wa baka mo shirenai, kore wa nani ni shite komatta koto ni natta" to omoi deshitaga, (...)</em></p><p>"My eyes can't simply not see a thing, at all, then would that mean that I'm a fool, these are most troubling words" were his august thoughts, however (...)</p><p>Speaking like a regular bloke if with the archaic <em>onore </em>as the kanji for <em>ore, </em>which historically was the etymological predecessor for the assertive male pronoun, originally a self-deprecating and humble first-person singular pronoun and also a less-so second person singular.</p><p>The narrator uses o'<em>omoi, </em>the honorific form of <em>omoi</em>, itself as clipping of <em>o'omoininaru</em> (the gentleman/lady thinks), this is the tone throughout the story in terms of the narrator using a courteous language and applying the right <em>keigo </em>when referring to the King.</p><p><strong>The Old Minister:</strong></p><p>The Old Minister is in Nagura's version called <em>Saishou </em>(宰相, "Prime Minister"), and is typically used for "Prime Minister" or in historical contexts for the personal adviser of the Emperor of China. As such he is named as the Emperor's foremost confidante and trusted courtier. He uses <em>watashi, </em>the gender-neutral pronoun to convey a formal personality - though he also uses <em>washi</em> which is the generic oldster pronoun:</p><p>『模様と云ひ、色合と云ひ、此織物にわしが全く感心した次第を必ず陛下へ言上に及ばくぞ。』</p><p><em>"Moyou to ii, iroai to ii, kono orimono ni washi  ga mattaku kanshin shita shidai wo kanarazu heika he gonjou ni oyoba zo."</em></p><p>"These patterns, these colours, this fabric is indeed most pleasing and I shall most certainly and accordingly convey this to His Majesty, I dare say!"</p><p>His language is overall very masculine with zo, an assertive masculine emphatic, hence "I dare say" in the translation.</p><p>Otherwise he does not diverge all too much from the other translations.</p><p>Kimura's version of the same line goes:</p><p>『オオ之れほども奇麗に織れた、色合と云ひ模様といひ、何一つ非難の入れ所がない、早速歸って王様に其旨言上致すであらう』</p><p><em>"Oo korehodo mo kirei ni oreta, kiai to ii moyou to ii, nani hitotsu hinan no haire tokoro ga nai, sassoku kaette ousama ni sono mune gonjou itasu de arou"</em></p><p>"Ah! You have woven most beautifully, these colours and patterns, they are beyond any mode of reproach! I shall most humbly convey the information as soon as the King returns!"</p><p>A bit more verbose, especially that it is "beyond reproach" and his usage of the humble verb <em>itasu, </em>"to humbly perform/do." His personal pronoun is the impersonal <em>jibun </em>(自分, "one") akin to the English "one" in formal registers, though this usage may merely be that of a reflexive pronoun than a distinctly personal one.</p><p>He also calls the Old Minister <em>Daijin</em> (大臣, "Cabinet Minister").</p><p><strong>The Swindlers:</strong></p><p>In Kimura's version they are not outright called Swindlers, merely weavers, though they are still are oleaginous:</p><p>『恐れながら申し上げます、私共は機織を商賣にして居る者で御座いますが、何か一つ織物の御注文は御座いませんか』</p><p><em>"Osorenagara mouhiagemasu, watakushidomo wa hataori wo shoubai ni shite oru mono de gozarimasuga nani ka hitotsu orimono no gochuumon wa gozaimasenka"</em> </p><p>"Pray allow us to most humbly state that we lowly ones are but weavers who sell our wares, but if you, Sir, would like us to give you one of our clothes?"</p><p><em>Watakushidomo</em> (we humble lot) reeks of self-deprecation, as does <em>gozaimasu</em> (to honourably be), including their usage of <em>gochuumon </em>(example, specimen) prefixed with <em>go</em> to make it extra polite. These decorous words is their mode of speech towards the palace guards - who oddly do not have any lines nor exchanges with the Swindlers in the original, since this is more of an adaptation of the original story than an outright translation.</p><p>When petitioning for His Majesty to undress himself, they say:</p><p>『では、陛下には直と御召代へ遊ばしては如何で御座ります、及ばずながら私共が、お着せ申しませうから、いざ此の鏡の前にお立ち遊ばしませ』</p><p><em>"De wa, heika ni wa hitatato omeshikae asobashite wa ikaga de gozaimasu, oyobasu nagara watakushidomo ga, okisemoushimashou kara, iza kono kagami no mae ni otachiasobashimase."</em></p><p>"Now then, if Your Majesty would please to deign and change Your Majesty's clothes, then however poor our meagre abilities may be, we shall strive to most humbly doff and garb Your Majesty. If Your Majesty would most graciously stand in front of the mirror and deign to stand still."</p><p>If the Swindlers were courteous towards the guards, they are outright kissing and licking the feet of the King. <em>omeshikae </em>(the monarch's change of clothes), <em>asobasu </em>(the monarch does), <em>okisemousu </em>(to most humbly ask to dress) and <em>otachiasobimase </em>(if the monarch most humbly would deign to stand still), whereof two of these uses <em>asobasu, </em>a form of "to do" uniquely reserved for royalty and nobility, here used in the last case with the archaic imperative case <em>asobamase. </em>They also attach <em>oyobasunagara </em>(to the best of one's ability; poor it may be) to  <em>watakushidomo</em> to produce a self-effacing request to the King.</p><p>Nagura however refers to them with <em>sagishi </em>(詐欺師, "swindler," lit. "masters of swindling") and they too are equally decorous using the same polite register as Kimura has them in their requesting His Majesty to undress. They use other polite forms in:</p><p>『此織物は蜘蛛の巣のやうに軽く厶りますれば、着ても着たとは思はれないかも知れません、でもそこが即ち此織物の一番貴いところで厶りまする。』</p><p><em>"Kono orimono wa kumo no su no you ni karuku gozarimasureba, kite mo kita wa omowarenai kamo shiremasen, demo soko ga sunawachi kono orimono no ichiban tokoro de gozarimasuru</em>."</p><p>"Since this cloth has the same light qualities as spiderweb, mayhaps Your Majesty is nobly thinking to try these wares on, then the location over there would be the most exalted place to try them on."</p><p><em>Omowarenai </em>the negative form of <em>omowareru </em>(to be thinking), which in turn is also a respectful passive form of the verb, here attached to the King's actions. The Swindlers use the archaic and extra-formal version of <em>gozaimasu</em>, namely <em>gozarimasuru, </em>complete with the conjectural <em>gozarimasureba</em> , which rarely appears outside of highly decorous writing.</p><p>The King offers them near the end of the story a rank of nobility which Kimura thought wholly them unworthy of, but Nagura is less of an uncharitable git and translates their rank of <em>Hofjunker </em>(Weaver Knights) as <em>Goyou orimonoshi </em>(御用織物師, "Honourable Weaving Masters").</p><p><strong>Lo, His Majesty hath naught on!</strong></p><p>The Nagura version renders the revelatory line as:</p><p>『でも王様は何んにも着て居ないは』</p><p><em>"Demo ousama wa nanni mo kite inaiwa"</em></p><p>"But the King is not wearing anything"</p><p>Rather straightforward, do not that <em>wa </em>is not the same as the emphatic particle but merely the grammatical particle <em>wa </em>here written as <em>ha, </em>but pronounced the same.</p><p>『何だ！　王様は何も着て居やしない』</p><p><em>"Nanda! Ousama wa nani mo kite iyashinai"</em></p><p>"What! The King is totally not wearing anything"</p><p>A bit more forceful, but the point is still communicated across, albeit reduced in terms of Kimura abridging and adapting the story to suit his own version.</p>

the king is undoffed?&quot;  said a person, then two people, and it passed from person  in an instant,. at least everyone said it,  「王様は裸體（はかだ）だ裸體（はかだ）だ」と呼×りだした、王様も如何にも道理（もっとも）と思ったから、非常（ひどく）こまってきたが、又おもひなほして、  &quot;the king is nude! he is nude!&quot;, they all yelled* - truly the king thought to himself that this was most worrisome, and he thought to himself again,  「イヤ、イヤ、裸でも何でも今さら仕方がない、兎角も終極（しまひ）まで行（やっ）てとほにやならぬ」と決心して、今一層ほこらしげに、優然と四面（あたり）をはらって進まれた、因て侍従衆も依然（やはり）ありもせぬ長裾を恭しげに持あげて、後にしたかって行ました、  &quot;nay, nay, be that as it may that we are naked, foremost we shall continue this to its conclusion!&quot; had he decided. right at that moment, at all sides, the troubled chamberlains continued, most reverently they kept going on with grabbing the long hem, right until the end.   *there is a kana-character that i could not clearly make out, hence the &quot;x.&quot;   as we can see - apart from the diction once more being quite archaic, the king (or emperor) is hellbent on continue to the &quot;ultimate&quot; (as he says) end of things with this procession - using the   shikatanai   - that literally is &quot;nothing can be done about it&quot;, but contextually corresponds to a wide variety of english sayings hence my faux-elizabethan choice to convey the nuance of the elderly and scathingly sky-clothed monarch's disgruntlement over this turn of events.  note that three entire words for naked are used in these paragraphs, namely:  眞裸 ( mappadaka ) - &quot;truly naked&quot; - thus butt-naked or &quot;undoffed&quot; in my translation due to the linguistic tone being markedly old fashioned. 裸體 ( ratai ) - &quot;bared body&quot; - highlighting that the royal presence is quite au-natural. it is within the story read as  karada,  &quot;body,&quot; via gikun, where the furigana - explanatory ruby - gives it an alternate pronunciation other than usual one. thereby stressing the point of the majesty's majesty being exposed. 裸 ( hadaka ) - the generic term for &quot;naked;&quot; as used by the king at the very end of the story.  on the topic of his majesty's body, when the swindler's proclaim the wish to garb his majesty in made-up rugs, they use highly decorous language with a few unique traits:  「是が御袴（おはかま）で、是が御服（おめし）で是が羽織でござりますが、凡て蛛（くも）のソよりも軽うござれば、御聖體（おからだ）に重い様な御繋念（おけねん）はさらさらでござりませぬ、實に此布帛の徳は其処に在る者でござる」   &quot;kore wa ohakama de, kore ga omeshi de kore ga hataori de gozarimasuga, subete kumo non yori mo karuu gozareba, okarada ni omoi you na okenen wa sarasara de gozarimasenu, jitsu ni kinu no toku wa soko ni aru mono de gozaru &quot;  &quot;this is the honourable  hakama , these are the honourable clothes and this is the  haori , sire, if all of it is as light as unto that of a spider's, your majesty needn't be so gravely worried in regards to the royal body being flowing so freely; verily, the very virtue of this fabric is that very thing (= cobweb light clothes).&quot;  first and foremost, i apologise if the wording gets clustered or verbose, these swindlers indulge themselves in prolix politeness. secondly, 御聖體 is usually read as and rendered in modern japanese as 聖体  (seitai , &quot;the holy body&quot;), here an imperial honorific for &quot;the body of the emperor&quot; where it is here given an honorific and read differently as  karada  (&quot;body&quot;), thus pronounced  okarada  (&quot;the honourable body&quot;), but written  oseitai  (&quot;the honourable holy imperial body&quot;); thus, the swindlers use the utmost decorous term to refer to the king's body, but garb it in a much less respectful - nevertheless polite - pronunciation for less nobility than that of the monarch of the nation that they are currently working for.   lastly, the terms they use for the royal garbs:  hakama, meshi  and  haori  are - apart from  meshi , which can also just refer to western clothes - terms used for traditional japanese articles of clothing. the   hakama   are the long and baggy trousers of ancient court-wear and the   haori   is the formal jacket worn over the   kimono  . thus he is understood by the native audience of the story to be wearing traditional robes and the fines">

Thereby stressing the point of the Majesty's Majesty being exposed.<br>裸 (<em>hadaka</em>) - The generic term for "naked;" as used by the King at the very end of the story.</p><p>On the topic of His Majesty's body, when the Swindler's proclaim the wish to garb His Majesty in made-up rugs, they use highly decorous language with a few unique traits:</p><p>「是が御袴（おはかま）で、是が御服（おめし）で是が羽織でござりますが、凡て蛛（くも）のソよりも軽うござれば、御聖體（おからだ）に重い様な御繋念（おけねん）はさらさらでござりませぬ、實に此布帛の徳は其処に在る者でござる」</p><p><em>"Kore wa ohakama de, kore ga omeshi de kore ga hataori de gozarimasuga, subete kumo non yori mo karuu gozareba, okarada ni omoi you na okenen wa sarasara de gozarimasenu, jitsu ni kinu no toku wa soko ni aru mono de gozaru</em>"</p><p>"This is the honourable <em>Hakama</em>, these are the honourable Clothes and this is the <em>haori</em>, sire, if all of it is as light as unto that of a spider's, Your Majesty needn't be so gravely worried in regards to the Royal Body being flowing so freely; verily, the very virtue of this fabric is that very thing (= cobweb light clothes)."</p><p>First and foremost, I apologise if the wording gets clustered or verbose, these Swindlers indulge themselves in prolix politeness. Secondly, 御聖體 is usually read as and rendered in modern Japanese as 聖体 <em>(seitai</em>, "the holy body"), here an Imperial honorific for "the body of the Emperor" where it is here given an honorific and read differently as <em>karada </em>("body"), thus pronounced <em>okarada </em>("the honourable body"), but written <em>oseitai </em>("the honourable holy imperial body"); thus, the Swindlers use the utmost decorous term to refer to the King's body, but garb it in a much less respectful - nevertheless polite - pronunciation for less nobility than that of the Monarch of the nation that they are currently working for. </p><p>Lastly, the terms they use for the royal garbs: <em>hakama, meshi </em>and <em>haori </em>are - apart from <em>meshi</em>, which can also just refer to western clothes - terms used for traditional Japanese articles of clothing. The <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakama">hakama</a> </em>are the long and baggy trousers of ancient court-wear and the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haori">haori</a></em> is the formal jacket worn over the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimono">kimono</a></em>. Thus he is understood by the native audience of the story to be wearing traditional robes and the finest of them as evident by the prefixation of the honorific <em>o-</em> on the words themselves. <em>Meshi </em>is also a courteous word for the food, garbs and articles that nobility own derived ultimately from the reverent multi-versatile verb <em>mesu </em>(召す, "the gentleman/madam wears/eats/drinks/sends for"), also appearing in most translations of the title of the story as <em>omeshimono </em>(御召物, "(the nobleman's) robes", lit. "honourable things to be worn"), though Takahashi opts for <em>Ousama no shinishou </em>(王様の新衣裳, "The King's New Clothes"), using the generic <em>ishou </em>(衣裳, "clothes"), rather than the honorific term.</p>

word for emperor, and the other, a simplification to possibly avoid lèse-majesté by rendering him simply a king.  hence, watanabe renders him a 帝 ( mikado,  &quot;emperor&quot;), which already at this stage was an archaic word for emperor and indeed could refer to the japanese sovereign at the time as well as the ancient chinese emperors. the world itself ultimately stems from the name of the mythological king of the gods of chinese mythology, hence it is more literally &quot;thearch&quot; (god-king). in addition to this watanabe also uses 皇帝 ( koutei , &quot;emperor&quot;), the more usual word for the office, taken directly from chinese title, itself invented by the very first qing emperor, thus steeping it in majestic tradition. fittingly he uses  yo  (余), the first person pronoun reserved for nobility as his mode of self-reference in watanabe's translation that is rendered in classical japanese rather than the informal variety at the time, hence the story has a much more stately if archaic ring to it.   其等ガ如何ナル肝要ナル衣服デアルデ有ルヨト帝ガ思考セシ若余ガ斯ル衣服ヲ着セシナヲバ余ハ余ノ帝國ニ於テ如何ナル人ガ彼等ノ職任ニ向テ不適當デ而ソ余ノ信任ヨリ價ナキモノデ有ル乎ヲ見ル可ク適當シテアルテ有フ、然リ余ノ即時ニ作ラレタル是等ノ衣服ノ一組ヲ持ッテ有フ其故ニ命令ガ直ニ初メル可ク二人ハ浪蕩者ニ迄デ與ヘヲレシ  其等が如何なる肝要なる衣服であるで有るよと帝が思考せし若余が斯る衣服を着せしなをば余は余の帝国に於て如何なる人が彼等の職任に向て不適当で而そ余の信任より価なきもので有る乎を見る可く適当してあるて有ふ、然り余の即時に作られたる是等の衣服の一組を持って有ふ其故に命令が直に初める可く二人は浪蕩者に迄で与へをれし   sorera ga ikanaru kanyou naru ifuku de aru de aru to yo to mikado ga shian seshi moshi yo ga karu ifuku wo kise shiwoba yo wa yo no teikoku ni oite ikanaru hito ga karera no shokunin ni muite futekitou de shikaso yo no sninnin yori atainaki mono de aru ka wo miru beku tekitou shite aru te au, shikari yo no sokuji ni tukraretaru korera no ifuku no ichigumi wo motte au ni meirei ga suguni hajimeru beku futari wa routousha">

                    <p><strong>Chapter I - The Earliest Translations -  Anno 1888 - Part I</strong></p><p>Hans Christian Andersen, one of the most widely read and translated authors of not just Denmark, but also the world has his works preponderate in terms of international versions to the point of equalling that of the Bible.</p><p>Thus, I in my interminable strive for further linguistic punishment and enlightenment am endeavouring to take on 14 distinct translations of <em>The Emperor's New Clothes </em>into the Japanese language, stretching from one of the earliest of 1888 to 1982, thus encompassing more than 100 years.</p><p>The very first translation of <em>Keiserens Nye Klæder</em>, as it is known in the original Danish, appeared in <em>Romaji</em> (ローマ字, Japanese transliterated into the Roman alphabet, hence literally meaning "Roman characters") as <em>Ō no atarashiki ishō</em> (lit. "The King's New Clothes") by Yasuoka Shunjirō, in the 1888 (year, not number) issue of the publication <em>Romaji zasshi.</em></p><p>I have unfortunately not been able to acquire myself a digital copy of said earliest translation, so I have instead been able to get the third translation to historically be published: <em>Mikado no aratanaru ifuku</em>  (帝ノ新ナル衣服, "The Emperor's New Attire") by Watanabe Matsushige (渡辺松茂) in 1888 and published in <em>Nyuunashonaru Daigo Riidaa Chokuyaku </em>(ニューナショナル第五リーダー直訳, "Fifth Issue of the New National's Reader, Direct Translation"). This was in very fact one of four translations to appear in 1888, together with the aforesaid Romaji-only translation.</p><p>Another of those translations appearing that year - as part of the four - is the one by Takahashi Gorou (高橋五郎), <em>Fuuseikidan Ousama no Shin Ishou</em> (諷世奇談 王様の新衣裳, "Satire World Colourful Story - The King's New Garments"), this along with Watanabe's will be covered in this series of analyses.</p><p>We shall in this first instalment look at how these two early pioneers in translating the (in)famous story of a pompous monarch whose dimwitted love for clothes lures him into not only being ridiculed, but also exposing his Imperial Court for mockery due to two swindlers whose offer of a delicate and magical garb proves all too good.</p><p>It is a scathing political satire that Andersen also grounded in contemporary political developments where Danish aristocratic politicians saw their ancient mode of life abruptly change in favour of the advent of a modern society according to Mary Tartar in her annotated translation of Andersen's fairy-tales - thus these noblemen wished to cooperate with younger members of their profession, hence the creation of extravagant titles (such as is the case for the Weavers.) Andersen furthermore pokes fun at the upper class that had derided Andersen himself for wanting to become part of it.</p><p><strong>Enter, His Majesty:</strong></p><p>The Emperor is himself a hapless creature of vanity, a grand adorer of gaudy clothes and above all else a cockalorum with a head too big to admit that he may be wrong - the perfect irreverent satire of how adults - but not one veracious child - may be deceived through deference into believing almost anything.</p><p>The choice of translating the monarch's title and indeed name, at this very early stage would set the trend for two currents - one wherewith they would preserve the title of the main character, but use the "international" word for emperor, and the other, a simplification to possibly avoid lèse-majesté by rendering him simply a king.</p><p>Hence, Watanabe renders him a 帝 (<em>mikado, </em>"emperor"), which already at this stage was an archaic word for emperor and indeed could refer to the Japanese sovereign at the time as well as the ancient Chinese emperors. The world itself ultimately stems from the name of the mythological king of the gods of Chinese mythology, hence it is more literally "thearch" (god-king). In addition to this Watanabe also uses 皇帝 (<em>koutei</em>, "emperor"), the more usual word for the office, taken directly from Chinese title, itself invented by the very first Qing Emperor, thus steeping it in majestic tradition. Fittingly he uses <em>yo </em>(余), the first person pronoun reserved for nobility as his mode of self-reference in Watanabe's translation that is rendered in Classical Japanese rather than the informal variety at the time, hence the story has a much more stately if archaic ring to it. </p><p>其等ガ如何ナル肝要ナル衣服デアルデ有ルヨト帝ガ思考セシ若余ガ斯ル衣服ヲ着セシナヲバ余ハ余ノ帝國ニ於テ如何ナル人ガ彼等ノ職任ニ向テ不適當デ而ソ余ノ信任ヨリ價ナキモノデ有ル乎ヲ見ル可ク適當シテアルテ有フ、然リ余ノ即時ニ作ラレタル是等ノ衣服ノ一組ヲ持ッテ有フ其故ニ命令ガ直ニ初メル可ク二人ハ浪蕩者ニ迄デ與ヘヲレシ</p><p>其等が如何なる肝要なる衣服であるで有るよと帝が思考せし若余が斯る衣服を着せしなをば余は余の帝国に於て如何なる人が彼等の職任に向て不適当で而そ余の信任より価なきもので有る乎を見る可く適当してあるて有ふ、然り余の即時に作られたる是等の衣服の一組を持って有ふ其故に命令が直に初める可く二人は浪蕩者に迄で与へをれし</p><p><em>Sorera ga ikanaru kanyou naru ifuku de aru de aru to yo to mikado ga shian seshi moshi yo ga karu ifuku wo kise shiwoba yo wa yo no teikoku ni oite ikanaru hito ga karera no shokunin ni muite futekitou de shikaso yo no sninnin yori atainaki mono de aru ka wo miru beku tekitou shite aru te au, shikari yo no sokuji ni tukraretaru korera no ifuku no ichigumi wo motte au ni meirei ga suguni hajimeru beku futari wa routousha ni made ataeworeshi</em></p><p>"To have those manner of clothes would be crucial, thought the Imperial Sire, "mayhaps if We be wearing these We shall be able to see which people of Our Empire be inappropriate and which be even more unworthy of Our credence. We shall then see who is fit of those We have. Yea, We shall have these made forthwith one suit of these garbs, this shall We order and grant to these two roamers."</p><p><em>(Any errors or grammatical mistakes in the above translation are all my own, since Classical Japanese is not my strongest suit. 申し訳ありません)</em></p><p>Thus, it billing itself as a "direct translation" also means that it renders all dialogue in the story in the same Classical Japanese style that in turn means that the Minister of the story also uses the same pronoun as the Emperor, which whilst fitting for both members of the Imperial Court nevertheless flattens the personality nuances and line individualism.</p><p>More nuanced however was Takahashi's translation, the very same year - albeit still rendered a stately prose:</p><p>そこで王様は考がへられた、「是は如何にも珍しい衣服（きもの）だ、是さへあれば余が臣下の中（うち）の任に堪ぬ人物を見わけることが苦もなく出来る伶俐者（かしこいもの）も愚味者も容易くわかる、善し善し、是は是非とも無くてはならぬ品だわい、」</p><p><em>Soko de ousama wa kangaerareta, "Kore wa ikani mo mezurashii kimono da, koresae areba yo ga shinka no uchi no nin ni taenu jinbutsu wo miwakeru koto ga ku mo naku dekiru kashikoimono mo orokamono mo tayasuku wakaru, yoshi yoshi, kore wa zehi tomo naku te wa naranu shina da wai."</em></p><p>Then the King thought unto himself, "That is verily a most rare cloth, indeed. If We had it in our possession We would easily be able to distinguish amongst our retainers who are the sagacious individuals and who are truly fatuous with little to no difficulty. Yes, yes, We most certainly shall need this article, We dare say!"</p><p>Things of note here are, his usage of <em>yo, </em>here rendered in the majestic plural; using the archaic negative in the modal phrase <em>nakerebanaranu </em>(ought to); he further more ends his sentence with <em>wai</em>, an emphatic sentence ending that only occurs amongst older dialects. Thus the Emperor, or King (王様, <em>ousama</em>) in this case, has his speech rendered in that of an ageing monarch. His old and trusty Minister (宰相, <em>saishou </em>- the ), uses the same kanji for the pronoun, but it being pronounced <em>ore, </em>the informal first person male pronoun. We shall however return to the venerable statesman later on in this series.</p><p>Whilst not couched in Classical Japanese, the language of the King is nevertheless archaic when compared to modern Japanese.</p><p><strong>The Imperial Elderly Minister:</strong></p><p>We will skip Watanabe's version of the Minister other than mentioning a few details:</p><ol><li>His title is translated as <em>shushou </em>(首相), a term that various is translated as "Prime Minister" as well as "Chancellor" (in reference to Germany etc.) and "Premier." Thus marking the Elderly Minister's role as the head of the Imperial Court, acting as an adviser to His Majesty. The word literally means "<strong>head (首)</strong> of the <strong>councillors (相).</strong>"</li><li>His language is largely the same as the Emperor due to the uniformly "direct" translation style into Classical Japanese, which did in fact have honorifics and the sort, but are avoided to convey a neutral tone.</li><li>As such his personality as an elderly if easily flustered statesman is completely ignored when rendered into a homogeneous linguistic context, such as the "direct translation" style that the publication that this 1888 translation first debuted in.</li></ol><p>Takahashi's translation gives us a different take from Watanabe's rigid version, he uses the same kanji - as mentioned previously - but pronounces it as <em>ore, </em>the standard masculine pronoun in informal and assertive speech thus conveying his personality as not necessarily geriatric as much as blunt when he is alarmed by his supposed incompetence due to not being able to see the magical cloth.</p><p>He is however not incapable of courteous language, since being polite is part of the august post as senior statesman, thus when he feigns being able to see the cloth and replies amicably towards the Swindlers:</p><p>「是は綺麗だ、實以て奇麗だ、模様（かた）といひ、色合といひ……おう左様（さう）だ、いづれ歸って、王様に十分満足した由（よし）を申しあげやうぞよ」と思ひきって言（いひ）ました、</p><p><em>"Kore wa kirei da, jitsu nite kirei da, kata to ii, iroai to ii ...... ou sou da, izure kaette, ousama ni juubun manzoku shita yoshi wo moushiageyou zoyo" to omoikitte imashita.</em></p><p>"This is beautiful, truly beautiful! These patterns, these colours. Yes, indeed, I have now more than ample satisfaction to report to His Majesty, I dare say!"</p><p>Other than <em>zoyo, </em>a markedly old fashioned emphatic particle that denotes surprise, the speech is standard male speech, albeit with the appearance of the humble verb <em>moushiageru </em>in its volitional mode "I will report most humbly" to communicate the Elderly Minister's part feigning being able to see the cloth and part wanting to reassure himself of his own competence and not making an idiot out of His Majesty, who has summoned the Swindlers under the misconception of them being true weavers.</p><p>In terms of his regular speech patterns in greater detail:</p><p>そこで宰相殿は又かんがへました、「余は實に愚かしらん、さうでも人にさう思はれてはならぬ、余は眞に無能かしらん、さもあらばあれ、此老面さげて、今となって人にそれを知れるのも口をしい、寧そ此布帛が見なかったなどとは言ぬが善らう、」</p><p><em>Soko de saishou-dono wa mata kangaemashita, "ore wa jitsu ni oroka kashiran, sou demo hito ni sou omowarete wa naranu, ore wa makoto ni munou ka shiran, samo araba are, kono roumen sagete, ima to natte hito ni sore wo shireru no kuchi wo shii, isso kono kinu ga minakatta nado to wa iwanu ga yokarou."</em></p><p>"Then did the Sir Prime Minister once more think, "Am I truly a fool? I musn't be thinking in such a way, am I truly without abilities? If that is so, this oldster's face shall be remove, if people come to know this... 'Twould be best if I say nothing at all."</p><p>We see <em>kashiran, </em>an older variaton of <em>kashira </em>(I do wonder), which in modern times is usually associated with female speech, but can also be gender-neutral in older registers. He uses the archaic form of <em>naranai </em>(must not) in the guise of <em>naranu</em> as well as the archaic negative <em>iwanu </em>(say not) instead of <em>iwanai</em>. He ends his sentence with <em>yokarou </em>(it would be better), the adverbial form of <em>yoi</em>, the positive particle, which is also here spelt with the kanji 善 (good/virtuous), possibly hinting at the prudent elderly's thinking - using such kanji for spelling the word itself is also relatively rare and old-fashioned.</p><p>The Minister is described here with <em>saishou</em>, an older word for "Prime Minister," typically used for royal ministers that serve a monarch and here the narrator suffixes his name with <em>dono</em> (lord/sir/master), an archaic honorific that is essentially more respectful than the standard <em>san </em>and less so than <em>sama</em>, which is what is used for the king <em>ousama, </em>albeit this term in a fossilised expression.</p><p>Him using 余, but pronounced as <em>ore, </em>shows the elderly minister as a member of the nobility, but speaking like a flustered and alarmed fellow.</p><p>He uses <em>roumen sagete </em>which I was a bit mystified as to what it meant, literally "hanging (one's) old face" as well as "removing the old face," which admittedly sound cryptic, it may be related to the saying <em>dono tsura sagete </em>(どの面さげて, "to have the nerve (to do something)", lit. "hanging with one's face"), or a pun on him feeling ashamed as such, but I came with as close as a guess I could to the meaning of this expression.</p><p>We shall in the next part look at the Swindlers themselves and how the key scenes are translated.</p>

            <article id="dickensian-japanese-stave-3-fred-jacob" class="gh-post" data-search-content=" in order to speed things up, let us take a brief look at the other principal characters and their main traits, and how translators handle them:   fred:   frederick is an amiable fellow and also the young sister-son of ebeneezer scrooge himself, thus his language ought at least to convey nuances of this cheerfulness youth that contrasts itself to the rigid miserliness of his uncle - since the two are very much opposites at the beginning of the story.  both shibaji, benibara (whose translation stems from 1911) and hataya give fred's first person pronouns as  watashi,  and  watakushi  (when he is especially formal). using the plurals affixed with  -tachi  and  -domo,  the latter being the most humble and formal. yaguchi, morita, yamanaka and yamamoto use  boku  and  boku-tachi  as he is singular and plural pronouns, the informal boyish first person pronoun - when he is being in a less tense situation - shibaji, benibara and hataya have him use  watashi  regardless of this. nakajima and hori (1928) give it as  ore  and  ore-tachi , the assertive male pronoun giving him a much more mature vibe, versus that of  boku.  he still uses  watashi  when talking to his uncle since it's the standard keigo pronoun.  interesting enough, fred switches from  watashi  to  boku  in yaguchi's translation, signifying a shift in formality, more specifically when inviting scrooge to their own home, he and his girlfriend.  fred universally uses  anata  and  ojisan  - an honorific if common version of &quot;uncle.&quot; whereas in his informal circumstances, except for shibaji, benibara and hataya, uses  kimi,  the informal second person singular that has a nuance of &quot;pal/mate/friend&quot; as in colloquial english. benibara has fred use the kanji 貴下 ( kika,  &quot;you, young gentleman/lady&quot;) for  anata -  very much tongue-in-cheek to his much more senior uncle.  thus far all except for the three, shibaji, benibara and hataya, reflect the youthful spirit of fred, whereas the former three render him somewhat more formal than what is intended in dickens' original version.  notable features include:   benibara has fred use the archaic  -mousu  (-申す) kenjogo verbal forms, e.g.  omanekimousu  (お招き申す, to humbly present an invitation), such as when fred invites scrooge to his own home to celebrate christmas. this is essentially a manner akin to - masu  from teineigo, i.e. the decorous copula. the only place where  -mousu  endings roam in contemporary japan are films set in in ancient edo.  hataya makes fred use  shibuzura wo serareru   (澁面をせられる, the sir/madam renders a sullen countenance) for when he remarks that scrooge has no right to look so gloomy and dismal.  serareru  (せられる) is a hyper-formal sonkeigo way of rendering the usual operative verb  suru  into a passive tense.   jacob marley   old jacob marley is coeval with scrooge and his business associate, thus it stands to reason that he should share some of his linguistic traits as well as a good manner of ominous and archaic diction considering that he lumbered his way from the stygian regions of the dead - replete with chains, moaning and the role as the harbinger of three ghostly visitations.  in terms of the first person pronoun there is wide variety:  boku (僕, &quot;i, the young male&quot;) is wholly used by yaguchi (1915), when marley is talking in a non-aggressive way to reflect his more meek nature, but also when he is issuing the warning of the ghostly visits and that scrooge must take heed of them.  ore (俺・おれ, &quot;i, the assertive man&quot;) is chosen by yaguchi (1915), hataya (1925), hori (1928), yamanaka (1941) and yamamoto (1948). these are used in most cases to stress his nature that is akin to scrooge, that of an ossified businessman, but in a ghostly reflection.    ware  (我・我れ・吾, &quot;i, the ancient being&quot;) is also used by kusano when marley proclaims his warning towards scrooge and announces the ghostly hauntings that shall teach him to be good.   washi  (私・わし, &quot;i, the old man&quot;) is opted for by kusano (1902), benibara (1911) and nakajima (1920).   watashi  (私, &quot;i, the formal, adult male&quot;) is used by kusano (1902), benibara (1911), hataya (1925), hori (1928), morita (1929) and yamanaka (1941), all of which to project marley as both a man of business, but also given the solemn/formal nature of  watashi , an admonishing character - though he does not change to  ware  in the majority of the translations.  plural pronouns are rare in these translations, but those that do appear are:   wareware  (われわれ) by yaguchi (1915),  warera  (吾等) by kusano (1902),  orera  (俺ら) by yamanaka (1941) and  oretachi  (おれたち) by yamamoto, whereof the two last are various plural-forms of  ore,  though the former is the more rough one with  -ra  as its suffix, these in turn convey the dual informal sense of &quot;me and you, scrooge.&quot; the two first  wareware  and  warera  sound ever so formal and fit the personality of marley.   coupled with these are  omae  (お前・汝・おまへ), the informal second person pronoun that acts as a rather informal and ass">

                    <p>In order to speed things up, let us take a brief look at the other principal characters and their main traits, and how translators handle them:</p><p><strong>Fred:</strong></p><p>Frederick is an amiable fellow and also the young sister-son of Ebeneezer Scrooge himself, thus his language ought at least to convey nuances of this cheerfulness youth that contrasts itself to the rigid miserliness of his uncle - since the two are very much opposites at the beginning of the story.</p><p>Both Shibaji, Benibara (whose translation stems from 1911) and Hataya give Fred's first person pronouns as <em>watashi, </em>and <em>watakushi </em>(when he is especially formal). Using the plurals affixed with <em>-tachi</em> and <em>-domo, </em>the latter being the most humble and formal. Yaguchi, Morita, Yamanaka and Yamamoto use <em>boku</em> and <em>boku-tachi</em> as he is singular and plural pronouns, the informal boyish first person pronoun - when he is being in a less tense situation - Shibaji, Benibara and Hataya have him use <em>watashi </em>regardless of this. Nakajima and Hori (1928) give it as <em>ore </em>and <em>ore-tachi</em>, the assertive male pronoun giving him a much more mature vibe, versus that of <em>boku. </em>He still uses <em>watashi</em> when talking to his uncle since it's the standard keigo pronoun.</p><p>Interesting enough, Fred switches from <em>watashi </em>to <em>boku </em>in Yaguchi's translation, signifying a shift in formality, more specifically when inviting Scrooge to their own home, he and his girlfriend.</p><p>Fred universally uses <em>anata </em>and <em>ojisan </em>- an honorific if common version of "uncle." Whereas in his informal circumstances, except for Shibaji, Benibara and Hataya, uses <em>kimi, </em>the informal second person singular that has a nuance of "pal/mate/friend" as in colloquial English. Benibara has Fred use the kanji 貴下 (<em>kika, </em>"you, young gentleman/lady") for <em>anata - </em>very much tongue-in-cheek to his much more senior uncle.</p><p>Thus far all except for the three, Shibaji, Benibara and Hataya, reflect the youthful spirit of Fred, whereas the former three render him somewhat more formal than what is intended in Dickens' original version.</p><p>Notable features include: </p><p>Benibara has Fred use the archaic <em>-mousu </em>(-申す) kenjogo verbal forms, e.g. <em>omanekimousu </em>(お招き申す, to humbly present an invitation), such as when Fred invites Scrooge to his own home to celebrate Christmas. This is essentially a manner akin to -<em>masu</em> from teineigo, i.e. the decorous copula. The only place where <em>-mousu</em> endings roam in contemporary Japan are films set in in ancient Edo.</p><p>Hataya makes Fred use <em>shibuzura wo serareru  </em>(澁面をせられる, the sir/madam renders a sullen countenance) for when he remarks that Scrooge has no right to look so gloomy and dismal. <em>Serareru</em> (せられる) is a hyper-formal sonkeigo way of rendering the usual operative verb <em>suru </em>into a passive tense.</p><p><strong>Jacob Marley</strong></p><p>Old Jacob Marley is coeval with Scrooge and his business associate, thus it stands to reason that he should share some of his linguistic traits as well as a good manner of ominous and archaic diction considering that he lumbered his way from the Stygian regions of the dead - replete with chains, moaning and the role as the harbinger of three ghostly visitations.</p><p>In terms of the first person pronoun there is wide variety:</p><p>Boku (僕, "I, the young male") is wholly used by Yaguchi (1915), when Marley is talking in a non-aggressive way to reflect his more meek nature, but also when he is issuing the warning of the ghostly visits and that Scrooge must take heed of them.</p><p>Ore (俺・おれ, "I, the assertive man") is chosen by Yaguchi (1915), Hataya (1925), Hori (1928), Yamanaka (1941) and Yamamoto (1948). These are used in most cases to stress his nature that is akin to Scrooge, that of an ossified businessman, but in a ghostly reflection. </p><p><em>Ware </em>(我・我れ・吾, "I, the ancient being") is also used by Kusano when Marley proclaims his warning towards Scrooge and announces the ghostly hauntings that shall teach him to be good.</p><p><em>Washi </em>(私・わし, "I, the old man") is opted for by Kusano (1902), Benibara (1911) and Nakajima (1920).</p><p><em>Watashi</em> (私, "I, the formal, adult male") is used by Kusano (1902), Benibara (1911), Hataya (1925), Hori (1928), Morita (1929) and Yamanaka (1941), all of which to project Marley as both a man of business, but also given the solemn/formal nature of <em>watashi</em>, an admonishing character - though he does not change to <em>ware </em>in the majority of the translations.</p><p>Plural pronouns are rare in these translations, but those that do appear are: <br><em>wareware </em>(われわれ) by Yaguchi (1915), <em>warera </em>(吾等) by Kusano (1902), <em>orera </em>(俺ら) by Yamanaka (1941) and <em>oretachi </em>(おれたち) by Yamamoto, whereof the two last are various plural-forms of <em>ore, </em>though the former is the more rough one with <em>-ra</em> as its suffix, these in turn convey the dual informal sense of "me and you, Scrooge." The two first <em>wareware </em>and <em>warera </em>sound ever so formal and fit the personality of Marley. </p><p>Coupled with these are <em>omae</em> (お前・汝・おまへ), the informal second person pronoun that acts as a rather informal and assertive mode of speech, notably Benibara, at times, uses 汝 to write the pronoun where it in normal circumstances has the pronunciation <em>nanji</em>, the equivalent of a Biblical "thou." Thus Marley is referring to Scrooge with an Old Japanese pronoun that grants it ancient force, but pronounces it as the colloquial direct pronoun <em>omae</em>, instead -  Kusano however keeps <em>nanji</em> as is and thus coupled with <em>ware </em>it renders Marley into an eldritch spectre. </p><p>Hataya (1925), Hori (1928) and Morita (1929) all have Marley use <em>omaesan </em>(お前さん, "you, good sir/madam)<em>, </em>a more polite if rural version of <em>omae - </em>that at the same time sounds old-timey and reflects his age, since Scrooge also reciprocates in some by cases by using the same pronoun.</p><p>Hataya (1925), Yamanaka (1941) and Yamamoto (1948) has him use <em>kimi </em>(君, "you, friend/mate/pal"), an informal less assertive second person pronoun to communicate a more amiable tone, but Yamanaka and Hataya have him switch to <em>omae, </em>when Marley becomes ominous.</p><p>Even more decorous has Hori (1925) with Marley using <em>anata </em>(貴方, "you, dear sir/madam"), the standard gender-neutral second person singular, that is the most polite of contemporary pronouns, he does switch over to <em>omaesan </em>after his introduction - presumably to illicit an air of mystery to Marley when he first arrives.</p><p>Marley uses <em>iru </em>and rarely <em>oru, </em>the first being the standard way of saying "to be" and the second the generic geriatric manner. They also end their sentences in a rather standard male way, i.e. <em>da</em>, but only Kusano (1902) and Benibar (1911) have him use <em>ja </em>(ぢゃ), the Hiroshima dialectal way for old people to speak. Only Benibara has Marley use the polite, if archaic <em>gozaru </em>(厶る), an honorific form of "to be," spelled here with an equally rare kanji, that normally means "I/me", but is seldom used - thus lending Marley further an ancient if courteous air, along with the 汝 read as <em>omae.</em></p><p>Both Benibara and Kusano use <em>zoya</em> (ぞや) as his emphatic particles at the end that give it almost the meaning of "gadzooks", whereas other merely use <em>ne, yo, na </em>and <em>zo</em>, normal ways of stressing surprise, friendliness or anger in the sentences.</p><p><strong>The case of "Man of the worldly mind!"</strong></p><p>Marley imprecates Scrooge for his lack of charity, ignorance of things beyond this world and knowing his place in the grander scheme of cosmos. How, then, do the translators handle his imprecations?<br><br><strong>Man of the worldly mind:</strong></p><p>Kusano (1902): <br>娑婆氣の多い斯固陋爺 <br><em>Shabaki no ooi Sukuruuji</em><br>"Oh Scrooge, thou of plentiful worldly thoughts"</p><p>It is worth noting that 1) Scrooge is written throughout Kusano's translation with kanji meaning "this Luddite oldster", i.e. 固陋 means "sticking to old ideas," but pronounced as one would the English name. 娑婆 (<em>shaba</em>) refers to the idea of the "corrupt world" as seen from a Buddhist lens. 氣 (<em>ki</em>) can also mean character/spirit/mind/nature.</p><p>Benibara (1911):<br>娑婆根性の人間<br><em>Shaba konjou no ningen</em><br>"Human of worldly grit"</p><p>Once again <em>shaba </em>recurs, but <em>konjou</em> that also means "disposition/character/guts" has with its many meanings ways of referring to Scrooge being gutsy and stubborn. <em>Ningen </em>whilst in modern terms meaning <em>Homo sapiens</em>, also stems from Buddhism to literally refer to the world of man, or humans as fleeting beings themselves.</p><p>Yaguchi (1915):<br>俗人奴<br><em>Zokujin me</em><br>"Wretched wordling"</p><p>俗人 if breaking it up means "worldliness" and "person", but is translated as "worlding" meaning "a person engrossed in the modern world," though here referring to the transient being of man. 奴 (<em>me</em>)<em> </em>is normally pronounced as "yatsu" (guy), but can be pronounced as the imprecating suffix <em>me </em>that denotes meanings such as "damned/fucking/wretched."</p><p>Nakajima (1920):<br>憐れな塵界の人間<br><em>Awarena jinkai no ningen</em><br>"Pitiable human of this fleeting world"</p><p>The Buddhist terminology strikes again, with <em>jinkai </em>lit. "world of dust," but also "drab world," refers to this impure/fleeting world that like particles of dust will pass.</p><p>Hataya (1925):<br>欲物め<br><em>Yokubutsu me</em><br>"Wretched creature of greed."</p><p><em>Yoku </em>can variously refer to "greed/avarice" and even "want." It is also used as a suffix for words denoting excessive craving such as: <em>donyaku </em>(貪欲, "covetousness"),  <em>inyoku </em>(淫欲, "lust"), <em>gayoku </em>(我欲, "selfishness"), <em>juuyoku </em>(獣欲, "carnal/animal desires") and <em>jinyoku </em>(人欲, "human passions/cravings). Thus old Jacob is not exactly holding back towards his dear chum in terms of writing out Scrooge's foibles. The suffix <em>butsu</em> is usually applied to objects or creatures, so Scrooge is debased twice: once in terms of being reminded of his cravings, but twice in terms of now being nothing, but a creature of them.</p><p>Hori (1928):<br>凡夫め<br><em>Ponpu</em> <em>me</em><br>"Wretched prthhag-jana"</p><p>Where "prthhag-jana" stems from Buddhism to refer to an unenlightened person, someone who has not yet fully grasped the teachings of Buddha, and as such Scrooge is being called ignorant by Marley - not so much for being a greedy git, but being deprived of that thing called "being nice at Christmas."</p><p>Morita (1929):<br>世間の欲に眼の暮れた男<br><em>Seken no yoku ni me no kurareta otoko</em><br>"Man lost with his eyes upon worldly wants."</p><p>As verbose as Nakajima, but more literal in terms of conveying Scrooge's incessant focus on worldly goods and the here-and-now, rather than thinking of others. 世間 can also mean more literally "this world of humans" (as in mortal/fleeting beings), and as such in a way related to <em>ningen </em>(人間, "human").</p><p>Yamanaka (1941):<br>Nothing.</p><p>Indeed. Yamanaka's translation is more of an abridged adaptation for children, rather than a faithful translation, thus terms that refer to culturally specific things and references to western religion are generally either left out or simplified. This has, however, not stopped any of the other translators of taking terms from Buddhism to fit the message of Scrooge being an ephemeral miserly speck of dust.</p><p>Yamamoto (1948):<br>下司な男<br><em>Gesu na otoko</em><br>"Churlish man"</p><p>Whereas the other Marleys at least were ominous and archaic in their diction, this one outright calls Scrooge a git - indeed, 下司 can also mean a "sleazebag, boor, churl" and thus "git" fits the bill, as well. It anciently referred to anyone of a lower, menial rank as compared to the upper-class - such as Marley being a member of the higher echelons of business society and therefore - his ghostly status notwithstanding - entitled to berate and call his friend, a low-life git. Harsh and snobbish, perhaps, but as a upper-class twit, he is apparently his right.</p>

            <article id="keigo-basics" class="gh-post" data-search-content=" as mentioned in the dickensian blog-posts, i will be presenting a short introduction to the basics of polite japanese and more pertinently using quotes from the translations to illustrate this.    in-group and out-group:   when talking about japanese politeness in general, one needs to approach two critical concepts, that of an in-group (内,  uchi , referring to the subject and their relations) and that of the out-group (外,  soto,  referring to the interlocutor/addressed and their relations).  hence the intricate relationship of the speaker and the spoken to decides which forms are to be used from the three main categories that make up  keigo  (敬語, &quot;polite speech&quot;) .    three main categories and their vocabulary:   there are, generally speaking, three groups within the umbrella of  keigo:  teineigo (courteous language) - applying  masu-desu  endings to verbal stems. kenjougo (humble language) - using suppletive forms of verbs to lower level of the speaker (and their in-group) in contrast to the interlocutor(s and the out-group). sonkeigo (reverential language) - using suppletive forms of verbs to elevate the status of the interlocutor and the out-group in contrast to the speaker themselves and the in-group.  &quot;suppletive&quot; refers to verbs that take on new forms when conjugated, as is the case with the english verb &quot;to go&quot; and &quot;to be,&quot; likewise in japanese you will find that the humble and reverential languages use distinct versions of verbs, such as for the usual  iu  (言う, &quot;to speak&quot;) there is in humble language  mousu  (申す, &quot;to humbly report&quot;) and in the reverential language there is  ossharu  (仰っしゃる, &quot;the sir/madam speaks&quot;).  thus, these forms are usually supplied with the courteous language endings,  masu  making the standard word  iu  into  iimasu  and the other two  moushimasu  and  osshaimasu , respectfully. beyond this there is the usage of forms such as  desu, dearimasu  or  degozaimasu  for the standard  da  and  dearu  (&quot;to be&quot;), which functions as the copula to the sentence - that have no actual equivalent in western languages.  henceforth, i will be using kenjogo, sonkeigo and teineigo to describe the humble, reverential and courteous languages, for the sake of concision.  in the three forms pronouns also vary, though infrequently so with teineigo, whereas for kenjougo the first-person pronouns are more prominent, such as  watakushi  and in sonkeigo it is the second person pronouns that has this with  anatasama , regular  anata  would fall under the category of teineigo, but it can also be used in informal language.  honorifics such as the all-purpose  san  and  sama  do technically belong to  bikago  (美化語, &quot;beautification language&quot;), but are also regarded as belonging to teineigo, so as to facilitating courtesy - as do the honorific prefixes  o-, on-, mi-  and  go-,  the former three for words of japanese origins and the latter one for those of sino-japanese origin, all of which in kanji are written 御, this can however also be used as an honorific suffix, but its usage as such is rarer.   illustrative examples - keigo in action:   「はなはだどうもあいすみません」とボブは言いました、「遅刻いたしました。」 「遅速した？」とスクルージはつけて言いました、「うん遅速だと思うだね、こちらへおいで、君、どうぞ。」  &quot; hanahada doumo aisumimasen&quot; to bobu ha iimahsita, &quot;chisoku itashimasita.&quot;   &quot;chisoko shita?&quot; to sukuruuji wa tukete iimasita. &quot;un chisoku dato omou da ne, kochra he oide, kimi, douzo.&quot;   &quot;i most humbly beg of your forgiveness, sir&quot; said bob, &quot;i have been late.&quot; &quot;you've been late?&quot; added scrooge, &quot;mhm, you are indeed late, should i think, do come over here, my friend, come now!&quot;  (yamamoto masaki (山本政喜), translation of  a christmas carol  from 1949)  here we see that bob uses  itashimasu,  a humble form of  suru  (to do, to perform) with the added teineigo suffix,  masu , giving it the present tense - this is in turn appended to  chikoku  (lateness), thus creating the most humble way of expressing that he has been tardy. additionally  aisumimasen  is a very formal apology, a variant of the more common  sumimasen,  hence my adding &quot;sir&quot; at the end.  scrooge however uses informal language, addressing bob with  kimi,  an informal pronoun that has connotations of friendliness in contrast to the more brash  omae  (お前), his usage of the polite imparitve  oide  akin to &quot;do come&quot; or &quot;please come,&quot; it can sound demanding and is rarer than  nasai , which is the more ordinary way of creating polite imperatives. he adds &quot;douzou&quot;, a polite request at the end thus adding a note of extra friendliness. which, again, has the effect of perhaps making bob uneasy with what could be scrooge merely taunting him with false avuncular benefaction - which, of course, in the end is revealed to be actual benevolence, when scrooge gives bob a much needed pay-rise.  「あなたは私が今までお目にかかったどの幽靈よりもこわいのです。しかし、あなたの目的は私にいいことをして下さることにあると知っていますし、今までの私とはべつな人間になって生きてゆきたいと思っておりますので、あなたのお伴をうけたまわり、しかもありがたい心でそうする覺悟をきめております。私に言葉をかけて下さいませんか？」  &quot;anata wa watakushi ima made omenikakatta do no yuurei yori mo kowai no desu. skashi ana">

He uses <em>watakushi</em>, the most humble of first person pronouns - a solid piece of kenjougo vocabulary, to indicate that the spirit is not part of his in-group and as such he must lower his own position to accommodate the appropriate respect, hence <em>orimasu </em>(teineigo form of <em>oru, </em>the humble form of <em>iru, </em>"to be") and <em>uketamawaru</em> (to humbly endeavour to perform), whereof the latter is highly archaic and only found in the most formal of circumstances.</p><p>Sonkeigo words include:<br><em>Omenikakaru </em>- To honourably be before, to meet someone - the form of <em>au </em>(to meet).<br><em>Kudasaru </em>- To grant someone something, to confer upon someone - the form of <em>kure </em>(to give, to bestow).</p><p>These function as to elevate the position of the interlocutor, in this case the last of the three Ghosts. The literal meaning of <em>omenikakaru </em>is "the honourable eyes are made upon (me)," and like <em>uketamawaru </em>is only found in the most formal of circumstances.</p><p>Standard teineigo forms found here are <em>imasu </em>of <em>iru </em>(to be) and the regular <em>anata, </em>that here communicates a neutral politeness, but is augmented by the previously mentioned decorous forms.</p>

in how the humble first person pronoun mutated into a  depreciating reference to another person rather than oneself.  the plural forms vary, yaguchi other than using  temae-domo  uses  wareware,  the formal first person plural that literally is a reduplication of  ware  (&quot;i&quot;), the old japanese first person pronoun, he and hataya use the kanji 吾々, which includes the reduplication of a rarer kanji for  ware , whereas morita opts for the more standard 我々.  yamanaka in contrast to the rest of them picks  watashi-tachi , the standard polite way first person plural without any hints of humility, notably due to  tachi , which neither too informal nor formal as a plural-suffix, whereas  domo  as seen above is a self-deprecating plural suffix when used for oneself or one's group.  when it comes to refering to scrooge and indirectly marley, the results vary less, but nevertheless significantly so: all of the seven translators opt for  anata  as the polite pronoun, but pick distinct kanji to write this word, and kusano goes one step further and has them refer to scrooge with  anata-sama,  the most decorous of second person pronouns.  kusano, nakajima, hataya and morita use 貴方 (lit. &quot;honourable direction&quot;) to write  anata , the standard gender neutral rendition, whereas yaguchi, beni bara and even morita furnish them with rarer kanji spellings namely, 貴下 (&quot;honourable one below me&quot;, used to refer to people younger than the speaker, normally read as  kika ) and 貴君 (&quot;honourable sir&quot;, used to refer to one's male social or age-wise equals, normally read as  kikun ). everyone, except for kusano, invariably also use the phonetic  hiragana  spelling あなた.   when enquiring as to if scrooge is indeed scrooge or whether or not he is his business associate jacob marley, beni bara, nakajima and hataya use  kochira-sama , an archaic if polite way of referring to another person, typically as a polite replacement for  kare  (&quot;he/him&quot;) or  kanojo  (&quot;she/her&quot;), beni bara includes the variant  kochira-san , substituting  sama,  the honorific suffix, with the more informal  san . morita and nakayama strip it of its honorific and use plain  ">

Fred is called "penniless" by Scrooge and the son literally refers to him as "one who has great (amounts) of money."</p><p>Fred is rather polite towards his uncle here, using お言ひ or お言い (in modern orthography), <em>o-ii</em>, a clipped form of the full <em>sonkeigo </em>verb <em>oiininaru </em>(お言いになる), equating to "The sir/madam said."

To which extent have you the  right have <em>you </em>to wish me that? Where is this reason for being so amused with yourself? You are broke, aren't you!?"<br>"Verily, sir," replied the nephew in good spirits, "To which extent have you any right to be so lugubrious? Why are you making such a sullen grimace? Aren't you a rich man?"</p><p>Scrooge goes from in Kusano's version calling Christmas "foolish," to saying "it can go to hell" or more literally if less Dickensian, "eat shit." This can also in some contexts mean "fuck off," which do not veil in the least the miserly old git's mood towards Christmas nor his fellow humans. Otherwise the linguistic formalities are the same as in the previous translation, note however that Fred uses the amiable emphatic particle <em>nee </em>as well as <em>gozatta, </em>the formal polite, if archaic, form of <em>aru</em> (to be) as well as the non-polite form of <em>gozaimasu. </em>This could be merely part and parcel of the Taisho-era's vocabulary.</p><p><strong>Nakajima Kotou:</strong></p><p>「クリスマスが箆棒ですって！　これは驚いた、小父さん」と甥は眼を丸くしまた。<br>「まさか然う仰有ったんぢゃ無いでせうね！」<br>「無いことがあるか。」とスクルージが言ひました。<br>「お芽出度うが聞いて呆れる。貴様なぞがお芽出度がる權利が何處にある？お芽出度がる理由が何處にある？貧乏人のくせに。」<br>「さあ、そんなら一つ伺ひませう。」と甥は元氣よく言ひ返しました。<br>「小父さんなぞがそんな陰氣な顔をして居る權利が何處にあります？そんな苦い顔をして居る理由が何處にあります？金持のくせに。」</p><p><em>"Kurisumasu ga berabou desutte!

Sonna nigai kao wo shite iru riyuu ga doko ni arimasu? Kanemochi no kuseni."</em></p><p>"Christmas is falderal, you say! You shock me, uncle" said the nephew with eyes wide-open.<br>"Good heavens, you cannot be expressing such things, sir!"<br>"Oh, no such things, eh?" said Scrooge.<br>"Who the <em>hell</em>, do you think you are fooling, when you are asking such things!? How can an arse like you have any right to think it auspicious? How can you have any reason for this? In spite of being so poor!"<br>"Well, permit me then most humbly to ask you this, sir." replied the nephew gaily.<br>"How have you any rights to put on such a miserable face! Such a face of utter spite, is there any reason that you have for that? In spite of being so rich!"</p><p>The good Frederick's politeness is kicked up a few notches here, with the <em>kenjougo </em>(humble speech) verb <em>ukagau</em> (to humbly ask) and the <em>sonkeigo </em>(reverential speech) verb <em>ossharu </em>(the sir/madam speaks). to reflect a much more decorous behaviour on behalf of Scrooge's sister-son. Scrooge, however, is still the same old git using <em>kisama</em> and in general using bitingly informal language towards him.</p><p><strong>Hataya Masao:</strong></p><p>『叔父さん、クリスマスが箆棒ですって！　まさかそんなことをおっしゃったんではないでせう、ねぇ！』と、スクルーヂの甥は言った。<br>『馬鹿らしいとも。お芽出度いクリスマスなんて何だ！　一體お前なんか芽出度がる權利がどこにあるか？　面白がる理由がどこにあるか？　貧乏の癖に！』と、スクルーヂが言った。<br>『そんなら、一本參りませう』と甥は元氣よく答へた。『叔父さんなんか不景氣な顔をぶら下げる權利がどこにありますか？　澁面をせられる理由がどこにありますか？　金持の癖に！』</p><p><em>"Ojisan, kurisumasu ga berabou desutte! Masaka sonna koto wo osshatan dewa nai deshou, nee!" to, Sukuruudi no oi ha itta.</em><br><em>"Bakarashii tomo, omedetai kurisumasu nante nan da! Ittai omae nanka medetagataru kenri ga doko ni aru ka? Omoshirogaru riyuu ga doko ni aru ka?

Shibuidura wo serareru riyuu ga doko ni arimasuka? Kanemochi no kuseni!"</em></p><p>"You say that Christmas is malarkey, uncle! You cannot truly be expressing such things, good sir!" said Scrooge's nephew.<br>"It is also foolish! What even is a <em>auspicious Christmas!</em> What the hell of an right have you to feel it is auspicious? What reason have you to fool yourself into believing such? In spite of being so impoverished!"<br>"Is that so, let me most humbly present this version," answered the nephew gaily, "Uncle, what right have you to be hanging with such a cheerless face? What reason have you for possessing such a sullen grimace? In spite being so rich!"</p><p>Same decorous tone from Fred, now also using <em>mairu </em>(to humbly perform/go), when beginning his reply to the sullen oldster. Scrooge, however, is less hostile with <em>omae, </em>but nevertheless still a miserly git.</p><p><strong>Morita Souhei:</strong></p><p>「聖降誕祭が馬鹿々々しいんですって、伯父さん！」と、スクルージの甥は云った。「まさかそう云う積りじゃないでしょうねえ？」<br>「そういう積りだよ」とスクルージは云った。「聖降誕祭お目出とうだって！　お前が目出たがる権利がにある？　目出たがる理由がどこにあるんだよ？　貧乏しきっている癖に。」<br>「さあ、それじゃ」と甥は快活に言葉を返した。「貴方が陰気臭くしていらっしゃる権利がどこにあるんです？　機嫌を悪くしていらっしゃる理由がどこにあるのですよ？　立派な金持ちの癖に。」</p><p><em>"Seikoutansai ga bakabakashiindesutte, ojisan!" to Sukuruuji no oi ha itta. "masaka sou iu tsumori janai deshou nee?"</em><br><em>"Sou iu tumori da yo" to Sukuruuji wa itta. "Seikoutansai omedetou datte! Omae ga medetagaru kenri ni aru? Medetagaru riyuu ga doko ni arun da yo? Binboushiki tte iru kuse ni."</em><br><em>"Saa, soreja" to oi wa kaikatsu ni kotoba wo kaeshita. "Anata ga inkikusaku shite irassharu kenri ga doko ni arun desu? Kigen na waruku shite irassharu riyuu ga doko ni aru no desu yo? Rippa na kanemochi no kuse ni."</em></p><p>"The Festival of the Holy Regal Birth is utter folly, uncle!?" said Scrooge's nephew, "you cannot truly be meaning such words, no?"<br>"Most assuredly I do!" said Scrooge. "An Auspicious Festival of the Holy Regal Birth, you say!? What right have you to feel it is auspicious for you? Where is you reason for feeling that it is auspicious? In spite of being impecunious."<br>"Well, is that so," replied the nephew with cheerful words, "Where is you right, good sir, to be in such a state of gloominess? Being in such ill humour, what is your reason for this, dear sir? In spite of being so splendidly wealthy."</p><p>And Fred has reached the apex of politeness with <em>irassharu </em>(the sir/madam is), an extremely decorous <em>sonkeigo </em>verb, and the translation is a bit more verbose, this time around, presumably to add the scathing sarcasm of the nephew in reply to his uncle's blunt insults. </p><p>Thus, we see the translators conveying the un-avuncular behaviour of Scrooge and the jovially polite, but sarcastic behaviour of the nephew through various means of informal versus formal language.</p><p>Scrooge, in Hayata's version, is particularly ill-tempered when his wishing the nephew to leave in a forcible manner is first rendered "please, quickly go home"<em> </em>(早くお帰り, <em>hayaku okaeri</em>), but as the confrontation escalates it becomes a blunt "go the hell home!" (帰りやがれ, <em>kaeri yagare</em>) which could - if one felt bold - become "fuck off home." Suffice to say using the imperative form of <em>yagaru, </em>an auxiliary verb denoting total disapproval of someone's actions to tell their nephew off is not the most Christmassy way of things to do.</p><p>In four of the versions Fred uses <em>watashi </em>(私), the gender-neutral standard polite pronoun, and only<em> boku</em> (僕), the standard informal male pronoun, in a single one - this gives Fred a youthful tone to his speech. The uncle, however, uses <em>ore </em>(俺), the assertive informal male pronoun to yell at his impertinent nephew, in all of the translations - where his other usual pronoun is <em>washi </em>(わし), the generic senior pronoun.</p><p><em><strong>To be continued in Part 2.</strong></em></p>

            <article id="dickensian-christmas-first-stave-phrases-and-terms" class="gh-post" data-search-content="  dead as a doornail:   marley was dead: to begin with. there is no doubt whatever about that. the register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker, and the chief mourner. scrooge signed it: and scrooge’s name was good upon ’change, for anything he chose to put his hand to. old marley was as dead as a door-nail.  mind! i don’t mean to say that i know, of my own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about a door-nail. i might have been inclined, myself, to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade. but the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the country’s done for. you will therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that marley was as dead as a door-nail.  (a christmas carol,  s tave one - marley's ghost, 1843)  thus begins the opening paragraphs of the first chapter of dicken's great christmas classic, stating in typical elephantine if sarcastic manner, and hammering home rather britishly that mortification of jacob marley, fraternal partner i business of ebeneezer scrooge.  the &quot;doornail&quot; shall play a pivotal role in this supernatural christmas tale as scrooge will encounter the spectre of marley not once, but twice throughout the first chapter of the story- one to the point, manifesting his face in the form of a doorknocker - one related through the genus of wooden portals to  doornail . therefore, jacob marley is quite ghostly alive as a &quot;doornail&quot; - provided that one has some leeway- animated as he is from beyond the grave.  how then ought the translator handle a pun that literally ties into as a foreshadowing of marley's later reappearance as the knocker of scrooge's door?  you can't really alter it to a different object as such with a similar mortal wordplay, as the reference will then be lost completely. doornails are by their very nature lifeless metal objects thus one could make the case that you could in fact preserve it as is and merely translate the the local word for something related to a door, but at the same time losing a familiar wordplay on a known aphorism for being completely dead - and instead strike the reader with a strange, at first glance, reference to bits of metal and the posthumous state of mr. jacob marley.  charles dickens also presents his narrator in the same overly courteous and cautious tone as he always does, setting the mood for the rest of the story in its macabre humour, and in contrast to the later moralistic sombreness with added elements of existential horror.  thus taking a look at the five translators and isolating the scope of the analysis to more accurate regard the &quot;old marley was as dead as a door-nail&quot; line:  kusano shibaji (1902): 老マアレイは鐶鈕（ひきて）のやうに死朽ちてゐた。  rou maarei wa hikite no you ni shi kuchite ite.  &quot;old marley was as rotten dead as a metal-ring-button (&quot;door nail&quot;).&quot;  yaguchi tatsu (1915): マアレエ老人は戸釘のやうに死んでしまった。  maaree roujin wa tokugi no you ni shinde shimatta.  old-man marley was as thoroughly dead as a door-nail.  nakajima kotou (1920): で、マーレー老人は、もう息の根がぴったりと止まってしまったのです  de, mârê roujin wa, mou iki no ne ga pittari to tomatte shimatta no desu.  &quot;therefore, old-man marley's life had stopped all and truly of a sudden.&quot;  hataya masao (1925): マアレエ老人は戸釘のやうに死んでしまった。  maaree roujin wa tokugi no you ni shinde shimatta  &quot;old-man marley was completely dead as a door-nail.&quot;  morita souhei (1929): 老マアレイは戸の鋲のように死に果てていた。  rou maarei wa to no byou no you ni shi ni hatete ita.  &quot;old marley was perished and dead as the tack of a door.&quot;  only nakajima seems to disagree on marley's terminal state, simply stating that that his &quot;life has stopped&quot;, whereas the others in a resolve to find a fitting japanese substitute go from a literal translation &quot;door-nail&quot; (hence my hyphening it, since there is apparently no word structure as such), &quot;metal-ring button&quot; which is then outfitted with the furigana/ruby for &quot;knob/handle&quot; ( hikite ); morita resorts to &quot;tack of a door&quot;, a more descriptive way of handling the state of mr. marley.  kusano in particular strikes home that marley is as &quot;rotten dead&quot; as a &quot;(door)knob&quot; and morita makes it clear that marley has &quot;perished&quot; and is &quot;dead.&quot; both stressing the inexorable status quo of scrooge's friend - which won't hinder him in revisiting his business-partner.  i have to say that i like the vividness of the above two. nakajima merely gave up on conveying the wordplay and just translating it straight up, without even trying.   bah-humbuggery:   “bah!” said scrooge, “humbug!”  (a christmas carol,  s tave one - marley's ghost, 1843)  kusano shibaji: 『ふん、馬鹿馬鹿しい！』と、斯固陋爺が言ふ。 &quot; fun, bakabakashii!&quot; to, sukuruuji ga iu.  &quot;hmph! how foolish!&quot; said scrooge.  yaguchi tatsu: 『バア！』スクルージは言った。『糞を喰へ！』  &quot;baa!&quot; sukuruuji wa itta. &quot;kuso o kurae!&quot;  &quot;bah!&quot; said scrooge. &quot;what a load of nonsense!&quot;  nakajima kotou: 「箆棒め！」とスクルージが言ひました。  &quot;kuraboume!&quot; to sukuruuji ga iimashita.  &quot;damn absurd!&quot; said scrooge.&quot;  hataya masao: 『何だ！　箆棒な！』と、スクルーヂは言った。  &quot;n">

                    <p><strong>Dead as a Doornail:</strong></p><blockquote>Marley was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that. The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it: and Scrooge’s name was good upon ’Change, for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as a door-nail.</blockquote><blockquote>Mind! I don’t mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the Country’s done for. You will therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as dead as a door-nail.</blockquote><p>(A Christmas Carol, <a>S</a>tave One - Marley's Ghost, 1843)</p><p>Thus begins the opening paragraphs of the first chapter of Dicken's great Christmas classic, stating in typical elephantine if sarcastic manner, and hammering home rather Britishly that mortification of Jacob Marley, fraternal partner i business of Ebeneezer Scrooge.</p><p>The "doornail" shall play a pivotal role in this supernatural Christmas tale as Scrooge will encounter the spectre of Marley not once, but twice throughout the first chapter of the story- one to the point, manifesting his face in the form of a doorknocker - one related through the genus of wooden portals to <em>doornail</em>. Therefore, Jacob Marley is quite ghostly alive as a "doornail" - provided that one has some leeway- animated as he is from beyond the grave.</p><p>How then ought the translator handle a pun that literally ties into as a foreshadowing of Marley's later reappearance as the knocker of Scrooge's door?</p><p>You can't really alter it to a different object as such with a similar mortal wordplay, as the reference will then be lost completely. Doornails are by their very nature lifeless metal objects thus one could make the case that you could in fact preserve it as is and merely translate the the local word for something related to a door, but at the same time losing a familiar wordplay on a known aphorism for being completely dead - and instead strike the reader with a strange, at first glance, reference to bits of metal and the posthumous state of Mr. Jacob Marley.</p><p>Charles Dickens also presents his narrator in the same overly courteous and cautious tone as he always does, setting the mood for the rest of the story in its macabre humour, and in contrast to the later moralistic sombreness with added elements of existential horror.</p><p>Thus taking a look at the five translators and isolating the scope of the analysis to more accurate regard the "Old Marley was as dead as a door-nail" line:</p><p>Kusano Shibaji (1902):<br>老マアレイは鐶鈕（ひきて）のやうに死朽ちてゐた。<br><em>Rou Maarei wa hikite no you ni shi kuchite ite.</em><br>"Old Marley was as rotten dead as a metal-ring-button ("door nail")."</p><p>Yaguchi Tatsu (1915):<br>マアレエ老人は戸釘のやうに死んでしまった。<br><em>Maaree roujin wa tokugi no you ni shinde shimatta.</em><br>Old-man Marley was as thoroughly dead as a door-nail.<br><br>Nakajima Kotou (1920):<br>で、マーレー老人は、もう息の根がぴったりと止まってしまったのです<br><em>De, Mârê roujin wa, mou iki no ne ga pittari to tomatte shimatta no desu.</em><br>"Therefore, old-man Marley's life had stopped all and truly of a sudden."</p><p>Hataya Masao (1925):<br>マアレエ老人は戸釘のやうに死んでしまった。<br><em>Maaree roujin wa tokugi no you ni shinde shimatta</em><br>"Old-man Marley was completely dead as a door-nail."</p><p>Morita Souhei (1929):<br>老マアレイは戸の鋲のように死に果てていた。<br><em>Rou Maarei wa to no byou no you ni shi ni hatete ita.</em><br>"Old Marley was perished and dead as the tack of a door."</p><p>Only Nakajima seems to disagree on Marley's terminal state, simply stating that that his "life has stopped", whereas the others in a resolve to find a fitting Japanese substitute go from a literal translation "door-nail" (hence my hyphening it, since there is apparently no word structure as such), "metal-ring button" which is then outfitted with the furigana/ruby for "knob/handle" (<em>hikite</em>); Morita resorts to "tack of a door", a more descriptive way of handling the state of Mr. Marley.</p><p>Kusano in particular strikes home that Marley is as "rotten dead" as a "(door)knob" and Morita makes it clear that Marley has "perished" and is "dead." Both stressing the inexorable status quo of Scrooge's friend - which won't hinder him in revisiting his business-partner.</p><p>I have to say that I like the vividness of the above two. Nakajima merely gave up on conveying the wordplay and just translating it straight up, without even trying.</p><p><strong>Bah-Humbuggery:</strong></p><blockquote>“Bah!” said Scrooge, “Humbug!”</blockquote><p>(A Christmas Carol, <a>S</a>tave One - Marley's Ghost, 1843)</p><p>Kusano Shibaji:<br>『ふん、馬鹿馬鹿しい！』と、斯固陋爺が言ふ。<br>"<em>Fun, bakabakashii!" to, Sukuruuji ga iu.</em><br>"Hmph! How foolish!" said Scrooge.</p><p>Yaguchi Tatsu:<br>『バア！』スクルージは言った。『糞を喰へ！』<br><em>"Baa!" Sukuruuji wa itta. "Kuso o kurae!"</em><br>"Bah!" said Scrooge. "What a load of nonsense!"</p><p>Nakajima Kotou:<br>「箆棒め！」とスクルージが言ひました。<br><em>"Kuraboume!" to Sukuruuji ga iimashita.</em><br>"Damn absurd!" said Scrooge."</p><p>Hataya Masao:<br>『何だ！　箆棒な！』と、スクルーヂは言った。<br><em>"Nanda! Kurabou na!" to, Sukuruudi wa itta.</em><br>"What! How absurd!" said Scrooge."</p><p>Morita Souhei:<br>「何を、馬鹿々々しい！」とスクルージは言った。<br><em>"Nani o, bakabakashii!" to Sukuruuji wa itta.</em><br>"What are you saying!? How idiotic!" said Scrooge."</p><p>"Bah, humbug" is here given renditions of being "foolish/idiotic", "absurb" or "utter nonsense", whereof the latter is very literally "eat shit," (糞を喰え, <em>kuso o kurae</em>, where it can also be translated in modern slang as "fuck off" or "to hell with it") which grants Scrooge a tone mostly in tune with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Christmas_Carol_(miniseries)">his 2020 gritty BBC self</a>, where "fucks" and "shits" are flung with extravagant Christmas charity. So on one hand there is similar wordings, albeit none quite captures the "humbug", though a case can be made for <em>kurabou</em> (translated here as "absurd(ity)" as a viable choice). <em>Kuso o kurae </em>on the other hand, a faecal imperative, if put into the hands of a translator more used to its modern meanings will turn Scrooge into a sulphuric character that would scarcely have made it off the printing press.</p><p>"Humbug" as a word means "trifle", "nonsense" or just "useless matter," hence the translation-choices of the above reflect how either idiotic or absurd Scrooge views the Christmas month.</p><p>Scrooge telling his nephew to "fuck off" would warrant much more than just a jovial "Christmas, a humbug, uncle?" and presumably not even the Ghosts would even be bothered with saving the old fucker.</p><p><strong>Christmas Itself:</strong></p><p>There is no exact exemplar quote to derive this from since it is an ubiquitous term not only in the story, but also its very seasonal foundation.</p><p>The translators either opt for using the regular katakana version of the name of the holiday itself:<br>クリスマス - <em>Kurisumasu</em> - "Christmas"<br>Or, in more creative ways apply this word as a rubi for already existing kanji compounds expressing a similar idea, which what I shall be listing below, with the actual reading of the word, should it be read without the <em>Kurisumasu</em> furigana.</p><p>Kusano Shibaji:<br>祝日 (<em>shukujitsu, "</em>national/public holiday")<br>This mostly appears in the name of the Ghosts themselves, whereas any reference to Christmas itself the loan word is used instead.<br><br>Yaguchi Tatsu, Nakajima Kotou and Hataya Masao:<br>They all use the loan word.</p><p>Morita Souhei:<br>降誕祭 (<em>koutansai, </em>"The Nativity", lit. "Festival of the Regal Birth")<br>Other than this Morita also uses 聖降誕祭 (<em>seikoutansai</em>, "Holy Christmas", lit.  "Holy Festival of the Regal Birth"), read as a regular word rather than with the loan-word reading <em>Kurisumasui, </em>and this is most often also used in conjunction with people's felicitations, thus "Merry Christmas" is rendered as "聖降誕祭でお目出とう (<em>Seikoutansai de omedetou</em>, lit. "An Auspicious Holy Festival of the Regal Birth [to you]").<br></p>

                    <p>Begin any JRPG, at least in terms of the early ones that was set during the Tolkien-esque fantasy golden age of the 80s and you will inevitably encounter terms such as <em>eiyuu </em>and <em>yuusha</em>. These two terms differ wildly for the most part in describing the hero of the story of an in-game legend that the designated player must fulfil in order to gain the mythic accolade of heroism. We shall in this short article look at how these terms differ from the English term "hero."</p><p><strong>EIYUU (英雄):</strong></p><p>This term literally consists of the components:<br>英 (EI, hanabusa) - <em>Heroic, flourishing, blossom, English, England.</em><br>雄 (YUU, o-, osu, on) - <em>Male, hero, leader, masculine, strength.</em><br>Rather virile semantics one might say, depicting the generic Hercules flexing his marmoreal muscles in various poses. The term however has a much more ancient pedigree rooted in Chinese mythology and history. The meanings of "English, England" for the former appertain to the usage of it as a phonetic component in a Chinese rendition of the name for the country itself, which since then Japan adopted into their own language - writing it as イギリス (Igirisu, "England/Great Britain" - itself a reading derived from the kanji 英吉利) or 英国 (eikoku, "England").</p><p>According to Kotobank the meaning is:</p><blockquote><br>才知・武勇にすぐれ、常人にできないことを成し遂げた人。</blockquote><blockquote>"A person who excels in wit, intelligence, military prowess and valour, that a normal individual would not normally be able to do."</blockquote><p>Thus someone of exceptional courage and wits, the very same as the semantics of the English word "hero."</p><p><strong>YUUSHA (勇者):</strong></p><p>Straight forward enough it literally means "a person (者) who is valorous (勇)" and this also fits with Kotobank's definition. In contrast to the <em>eiyuu</em>, a <em>yuusha</em> is singularly characterised by their valour, rather than having extraordinary intelligence. It is nevertheless also used as a synonym for <em>eiyuu</em>, and as a translation for our "hero."</p><p><strong>WITHIN THE TRADITION OF JAPANESE ROLE-PLAYING GAMES:</strong></p><p>The term <em>yuusha</em> reigns supreme as became readily apparent, whilst researching for this topic. <em>Eiyuu </em>seemingly being the more formal choice.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/12/link-yuusha.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="313" height="365"></figure><p>ぼく　リンクっていうんだ<br>真の<strong><u>勇者</u></strong>になるため　世界を旅しているんだよ<br><br><em>Boku Rinku te iunda</em><br><em>Shin no <strong><u>yuusha</u></strong> ni naru tame sekai o tabi shite irundayo</em></p><p>"I am called Link.

"Gozaimasu" here works as a decorous if humble way of saying "I am", but it can also mean "you are" or "it is" depending on context since it is literally the honorific version of most verbs meaning "to be."</p><p>As mentioned I shall post more upon this topic later.</p>

Træk inkludere: わし (washi, førsteperson singularis), おぬし (andenperson singularis), ぬ (negations-partikel), よい (positiv partikel) og じゃ (sætnings-endelse), hvoraf i det ovenstående citat ses 使わぬ (tsukawanu, "bruger ikke"), istedet for standarden 使わない (tsukawanai), hvor denne benytter den gamle negation -nu, frem for det nyere -nai. Endvidere kan vi se den klassiske adjektivistiske endelse -ki (き) istedet for -i (い) i adjektivet 正しき (tadashiki, "korrekt, ret"), istedet for 正しい (tadashii).</p><p>Lysmand oversætter denne gamle og vise tone ganske korrekt, med ordvalg som "de ondes vej" og han bruger også andre steder lignende poetiske billedsproglige udtryk. Samtidigt i tidligere bind er han ikke hævet over langt mere nutidige og helt-nede-på-jorden bandeord som "pis," hvor han på japansk blot bruger ganske neutrale udråbsord.</p><p>Muligvis gemmes Skildpaddernes Herres mere poetiske ordforråd til øjeblikke, hvor det rigtigt gælder og i de andre tilfælde er han blot en gammel gris med de samme sproglige tilbøjeligheder som alle andre folk. Der er også specifikt når han forklare teknikker, forhistorier eller kæmper i mere alvorlige stunde at Skildpaddernes Herre påtager sig en mere seriøs mine og vokabular, hvor Tranernes Herre, sin gamle med-elev, konstant udtrykker sig i et affældigt og arrogant sprog.</p><p><strong>Freezer</strong></p><p>Freezer er en sand transmogrif når det kommer til replik individualisme, hvor han har hele tre måder at udtrykke sig på, alt efter hvilken af sine fire forvandlinger han er i - hvor sin ordinære skikkelse udlukkende (med et par få undtagelser) benytter sig af <em>keigo</em>, "høfligt sprog" - hvilket skal forstås at Toriyama byggede Freezers tale-mønstre på slibrige ejendomsmæglere der alle bruger <em>keigo </em>for at indsmiger sig på deres kunder. Freezer er så selv øverst-ansvarlig for en hel hær af kriger der udraderer lokal befolkningen på fjerne kloder for så at kunne sælge dem videre til højeste bydende, altså en tyrannisk planetejendomsmægler.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/11/Freezer-25.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1110" height="696" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Freezer-25.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Freezer-25.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/11/Freezer-25.png 1110w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>よーーくみておきなさい　めったにみられるのではありませんよ<br>サイヤ人の住む惑星ベジータを攻めこんだときに王と戦った場合もまったく変身する必要もなく勝ってしまいましたから…<br>ベジータさん…あなたのおとうさんもたいしたことありませんでしたね<br><br><em>Yôôku miteokinasai metta ni mirareru no de wa arimasenyo</em><br><em>Saiyajin no sumu wakusei Bejîta o semekonda toki ni ou to tatakatta baai mo mattaku henshin suru hitsuyou mo naku katte shimaimashitakara...</em><br><em>Bejîta-san ... anata no otousan mo taishita koto arimasendeshita ne</em><br><br>"I bør venligst berede jer selv, dette er en hændsel som kun de færreste for at se<br>Det var slet og ret unødvendigt for mig at forvandle mig, da jeg skulle angribe planeten Vegeta, samt at bekæmpe og besejre kongen, forstår I.<br>Deres fader, hr.

Freezer er i den danske tilnærmelse helt og aldeles Des med hovedpersonerne, også selvom han udstråler en fjendtlighed overfor dem - al sammen i perfekt harmoni med den falske pli, som Toriyama byggede på de gelasne ejendomsmæglere, som han brugte som grundlag for Freezers personlighed. I den japanske original taler Freezer til Vegeta/Vejita, ét af hovedpersonerne, og nævner hvordan hans fader (<em>otousan</em>, det høflige ord for "fader") var "ikke en stor sag (<em>taishita koto arimasen, </em>den høflige form af <em>taishatakoto [de wa] nai), </em>og tilmed kalder ham for <em>-san</em> (hr.) for at håne ham. Alt dette er forkastet til fordel for at gøre Freezer gemytlig, men stadigvæk arrogant, hvormed han siger at Vegetas far var "for nem," hvilket selvfølgelig er en langt mere hånende og ligefrem måde at frasere det på. fremfor den mere hoverende måde med <em>keigo, </em>der kan ses i den japanske originaltekst.</p><p>Når Freezer først skifter skikkelse til en langt mere muskuløs kæmpe, skifter han således register til en maskulin ordform.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/11/Freezer-2-25-1.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="837" height="370" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Freezer-2-25-1.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/11/Freezer-2-25-1.png 837w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>きさま　ただのチビではないようだな…　いまのはさすがのオレもすこしいたかったぞ…<br>しかし　あいてがわるかったな…　ただ怒りを買っただけだ…<br><br><em>Kisama tada no chibi de wa nai you da na... ima no wa sasuga no ore mo sukoshi itakatta zo...</em><br><em>Shikashi aite ga warukatta na... tada ikari o katta dake da...</em><br><br>"Din lille...

Det dér gjorde faktisk en smule ondt...<br>Nu er jeg bare endnu mere rasende!"<br>(Dragon Ball, bind 25, side 132)<br><br>Vel at mærke bruger Freezer i den japanske <em>kisama</em>, et pronomen der i andre omstændigheder kan antyde betydninger som "skiderik" eller sågar "kæltring," men i konteksten af at Freezers modstander er Gohan, sønnen af seriens helt, og at den oprindeligt optrådte i et magasin for unge børn, må "din lille..." regnes for mere passende. Med det sagt undgår Lysmand komplet at nævne dette aspekt i sin oversættelse, hvor han blot har kernen af replikenes betydning, men ikke de mere præcise nuancer.</p><p>I sin tredje form der ligner en Xenomorph fra Alien filmene, med dets aflange kranium og reptilske krop, antager Freezer sig atter sin falske høflige gemyt:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/11/freeza-watakushi.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="295" height="552"></figure><p>大サービスでごらんにいれましょう！！<br>わたくしの最後の変身を…<br>わたくしの真の姿を！！！<br><br><em>Dai sâbisu de goran ni iremashou!!</em><br><em>Watakushi no saigo no sugata o...</em><br><em>Watakushi no shin no sugata o!!!</em><br><br>"Jeg vil da allerydmygest gøre d'Herre en kæmpe tjeneste!!<br>At vise Dem, min endelige transformation....<br>Selveste min sande fremtoning!!!"<br>(Dragon Ball, bind 26, side 44)</p><p>Det mest signifikante aspekt her er brugen af <em>watakushi </em>(わたくし), det mest høflige førsteperson singularis og hele sin tredje form er gennemsyret af <em>kenjougo </em>(ydmygheds-sprog) fraser.</p><p>John Lysmand giver os:</p><p>"Jeg er virkelig flink!<br>Nu får I lov til at se...<br>...min sande fremtoning!"<br>(Dragon Ball, bind 26, side 44)</p><p>Ingen markante ændringer udover en mangel på politesse.</p><p>Anderledes, men ikke mindre hånende, bliver det, når han skifter skikkelse til sin sande fremtoning:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/11/freezer-boku-2-1.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="391" height="535"></figure><p>ここまでやるとはね………<br>ボクにホコリをつけたのは親以外ではキミが初めてだよ<br><br><em>Kokomade yaru to wa ne.........</em><br><em>Boku ni hokori o tsuketa no wa oya igai de wa kimi ga hajimete dayo</em><br><br>"Du har gjort det flot, kære ven.........<br>Du er den første bortset fra min fader til at have givet mig en lag grus!"<br>(Dragon Ball, bind 26, side 130)</p><p>Her bruges det uformelle, venskablige og ikke mindst lettere barnlige førsteperson singularis <em>boku</em> (ボク) sammen med <em>kimi </em>(キミ), det uformelle og ligeså venlige andenperson singularis, hvilket giver ham en ungdommelig og drenget personlighed - et forvrænget og skræmmende sprogmønster der forstærker sin allerede eksisterende hånende tone overfor sine modstandere.</p><p>Hvor John Lysmand giver os:<br></p><p>"Slet ikke ilde.<br>Jeg fik da en mundfuld grus."<br>(Dragon Ball, bind 26, side 130)<br><br>Skuffende er der ikke just en antydning her af den falske flinke attitude, men andetsteds bruger Lysmand udtryk som "kære ven" til at understrege brugen af pronominer såsom <em>kimi</em> til at udtrykke en hoverende og belærende væremåde overfor hovedpersonerne, hvortil det også kan siges at <em>kimi</em>, da også bruges på japansk når en lærer tiltaler en elev.</p><p>Disse to aspekter mellem falsk underdanighed og bramfri arrogance bruges således skiftevis mellem alle Freezers transformationer. I sin fjerde forvandlig vil Freezer også fuldstændigt kaste bort sin patroniserende facade og bruge det maskuline <em>ore</em> sammen med talemønstre ikke helt ulig det fundet i sin anden forvandling.

For eksempel er der de hyppige <em>chikushou </em>(ちくしょう), hvis betydning som regel er ”pokkers også” eller ligefrem ”fandens også”, vitterligt er det et religiøst udtryk der hentyder til den laveste kaste af genfødsler – dyrenes rige (畜生), heraf dets brug som et skældsord. At kalde en person for dette er tilsvarende til ”din skiderik” eller det som er værre. <em>Kuso </em>(くそ), hvis vitterlige betydning er ”møg/lort/afføring/kompost” (糞) har en betydningsvidde der spænder fra ”sørens også” til ”pisselort”, alt afhængigt af hvem, hvordan og hvornår. I en tegneserie primært til et yngre publikum, må man skønne at ”fordømt/pokkers” og deslige er nok et bedre bud på en oversættelse.</p><p>Med denne overdrevne grad af bandeord til side er oversættelsen stadigvæk tro mod Toriyamas originaltekst, som kan ses fra oversættelserne i kursiv, der er mine egne. Jeg har skam slet ikke personligt noget imod en god og sund omgang mundsvolv når det kommer til eder og banderi, men samtidigt var dette ikke den oprindelige ordtone i Dragon Ball.</p><p>Endvidere bør man sige at det er ikke et konkret faktum at bandeord gøre en serie mere voksen blot fordi de bruges i overflåd.</p>

Purple, yellow and green. Everything blended together and separated. A fog of blinding colours. He could barely see Faxy nor hear its neighing as a tremendously piercing tone, an unearthly thunder dinned over the farm. The aether itself was vibrant and tonitrous. The tone itself increased in potency and then sank, reduced to the point where it sounded like that of a voice. Still imperceptibly deep. Ægidius could not fathom what the sound sounded like. His brain sped with several neurons an hour to process the information. It sounded like a voice yet it wasn't. Not that of a human. He could sense words, but not those of any human.</p><p>The voice continued ceaselessly with a series of unconnected utterances whereto it at last approached a recognisable language as his brain had grown accustomed to this  or at the every least deciphered this fulminating Stentor-voice.</p><p>“SALUTATIONS”</p><p>Although Ægidius never had heard the word before his brain recognised it in some strange fashion. Ægidius wasn't so easily frightened though. He cocked the gun and most certainly wanted to know what this cheeky fog wanted with him and at such a discourteous hour of the day.</p><p>“Heyup!”</p><p>There went a moment and a voice tore its way through the air.</p><p>“MINE APOLOGIES”</p><p>The purple, yellow and green light within the blinding fog began to spin, dance and orbit each other. Their waltz had a peculiar choreography. Almost like a birth. Their astral dance became more chaotic, but it had contrarily concordance. Their dance grew tighter. Ægidius could hardly believe his eyes. The air grew humid. The heavens above him shot forth lightning. The lightning hit the fog. More lightning hit it. All of the weather went amuck in this numinous dance. Ægidius could almost see a rhythm in the lightning strikes and their contact with the light, together with the light's humming and whirling. Curiously not a bad melody, he thought to himself. Suddenly a myriad struck down in an instant down into the fog that almost glowed so strongly that night became day. Ægidius waited patiently. The fog solidified as if embraced by a field of electricity. Behind this celestial shell he noticed that the three colours went into a union. Forming an entity of sorts. Now the shape behind this transparent, but radiant cocoon took upon itself a humanoid likeness. Legs, arms, head, an entire body, but the dimensions were monstrously huge. Ægidius witnessed how this shape now towered above him. The cocoon grew denser and denser until the light had taken a firm formation. No longer danced, but still pulsated in a consistent rhythm.</p><p>It grew even firmer and then a mighty shockwave was emitted from it. Everything around was blown away, but Ægidius stood defiantly. The field blew to and fro. Dust was whirled up. Day became yet again night. The fog of light was gone and Ægidius beheld now a creature, a purple man. 4 metres in height. His eights beamed, pulsated as the previous fog, but with a regular harmony.</p><p>Ear, nose and mouth had it. A glowing tuxedo of yellow and green nuances clothed this visitor. The man removed some of the dust from his tuxedo. Sighed and utter yet another word.</p><p>“VERY WELL”</p><p>Ægidius was somewhat impressed by the waltz of light and next this strange guest's appearance. HE took his pipe out of his mouth. Didn't quite know if he should use his gun.</p><p>“I AM DENOMINATED B100B, BUT DUE TO ANIMADVERSION OF INCOMPATIBILITY WITH THY CURRENT CEREBRAL COGNITION, CANST THOU REFER TO ME AS BOB”</p><p>Ægidius smoked his pipe and said now slightly suspicious:</p><p>“What the devil be ye gibberin' on 'bout, beetroot?”</p><p>BOB was about to speak, but was stopped by Ægidius whose indignation had grown:</p><p>“Ye dash down to me farm, be a-glowin' brighter than New Year's Eve, ruin me bleedin' fields and have the soddin' cheek to think that us be chums? Damnation-and-blazes to it all! What be ye a-wantin' of me?”</p><p>BOB stood a while. Then a mysterious buzzing was heard from his head. Eyes lit.</p><p>“A PERTINENT SCISCITATION, ÆGIDIUS JULES HILDEPHONSE APPLEBY!”</p><p>Ægidius had never had many visitors at his farm aside from O'Frederick from the city who habitually delivered horse fodder. This giant didn't look like any of O'Frederick's lads.</p><p>“Sciscitation? Question? Think ye be a-foolin' me with yourn mighty words, clever-sides?”</p><p>“MY MISSION IS PACIFIC, NOT ANTAGONISTIC, ÆGIDIUS JULES HILDEPHONSE APPLEBY. PLEASE WITH THY PERMISSION ALLOW ME TO BE MAXIMALLY PAUCILOQUENT AND MINIMALLY GRANDILOQUENT AS SUCH COMMUNICATION OBSTRUCTETH THE DIRECTIVE”</p><p>The giant stood still for a moment and then his eyes shone polychromatically.</p><p>“ÆGIDIUS JULES HILDEPHONSE APPLEBY, THY PLANET HATH BEEN ELECTED. IT IS THE INTERGALACTIC PLURALITY THAT HATH DESIGNATED ME AS REPRESENTATIVE”</p><p>It took Ægidius a brief time to understand the words. Sounded a wee bit clandestine. Intergalactic. Plurality. Sounded like something municipal. What did the municipality want with him? He had harvested fields the right way, hadn't he? He did mention planet though. The giant made no sense.</p><p>“Representative for what?”</p><p>“THE PROMOTION OF THE TECHNOLOGICAL EVOLUTION AND FURTHERANCE OF INFERIOR SAPIENT ORGANIC CONSTRUCTS' CIVILISATIONS”</p><p>“In English, Sir Gobsworth”</p><p>“MY MOST APPROPRIATE APOLOGIES! I MISANALYSED THY CEREBRAL VOCABULARY. WE ARE SEEKING SPECIFICALLY TERRA-01 TO ASSIST IN ITS TECHNOLOGICAL EVOLUTION”</p><p>“Where 'cham in this'n equation?” asked Ægidius”</p><p>“ELEMENTARY, THOU ART A SENEATOR FOR THY PLANET” said BOB.</p><p>“Senator? That be a-smellin' o' politics. Why it be me, hm? Why has the municipality send ye?” asked Ægidius.</p><p>“PSYCHOSOMATIC AS WELL AS PSYCHOSOCIAL ANALYSES AND CALCULATIONS OF THY CIVILISATION'S CEREBRAL AS WELL AS CULTURAL CAPACITIES THUS IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT VERILY THEE WERT THE OPTIMAL CANDIDATE” said BOB.</p><p>“Who did this? 'Tis a wee bit too technical for the municipality. Methinks it a mistake” said Ægidius and had in the most curious way found an interest in talking with the stranger.</p><p>“IT IS A RARITY FOR THE TRANSUNIVERSAL PROFUNDITY OF THE INTERGALACTIC PLURALITY TO MISCALCULATE. ONLY ONE OUT OF</p><p>540.305.304.405.505.505 CALCULATIONS HATH BEEN A MISCALCULATION.”</p><p>”I see, so..?”</p><p>”THE CALCULATION OF THE OMNIVERSAL VERACITY. BUT THIS IS IRRELEVANT. THOU SHALT EXPEDITIOUSLY BE TAKEN TO THE HEAD QUARTERS OF THE PLURALITY”</p><p>Now Ægidius was thinking that he was rarely on holiday. Last time it was the local beach. Plurality. He could need a break from his usual job.</p><p>”Tell me. What be a-happenin' with me fields?”</p><p>”THE MUNIFCATION OF THINE AGROCULTURAL RESOURCES SHALL NOT BE A SOURCE OF TROUBLANCE . THIS STELLAR REGION WILL BE TEMPORALLY STATIC WHILST WE ARE IN THE COURT OF THE PLURALITY” said BOB.</p><p>”Static..?”</p><p>”EH… TIME STANDETH STILL”</p><p>”Why in the blazes, be ye not a-sayin' that afore then!?”</p><p>”THE COMMUNICATION DIRECTIVE STATETH THAT A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PLURALITY MUST EXPRESS THEMSELVES WITH MAXIMAL PRECISION AND WITHOUT SEMANTIC AMBIGUITIES. I AM CURRENTLY COMMUNICATING WITH THEE ON PAUCILOQUENCE LEVEL 2”</p><p>”So what? Ye says I be dumb?”</p><p>”OBJECTIVELY I AM COGNITIVELY SUPERIOR, BUT HAVE NOT A COMPARABLE PHYSIOLOGICAL STRUCTURE”</p><p>“So that be a yes”</p><p>The conversation could have gone on for all eternity,but Ægidius was quite inquisitive, but he had to have his sleep.</p><p>“Tell me, how long be this trip a-takin', Ribena Bob? 'Cham needin' me dear sleep”</p><p>BOB stopped and his face changed itself with a great deal of contorting and stretching to an inexpressive one to one, that if you had a whole lot of fantasy, a smile. This could hint towards BOB being happy.</p><p>“FASCINATING. YE SAPIENT ORGANIC CONSTRUCT NEED OF COURSE NOCTURNAL PSYCHOSOMATIC REVIVIFICATION. FEAR NOT! OUR TRANS-DIMENSIONAL PASSANCE INFLUENCETH NOT THY PHYSIOGNOMY THUS NOCTURNAL REVIVIFICATION IS NOT ANATOMICALLY OBLIGATORY”</p><p>“To wind wi't. 'Cham ready. Ain't be happin' much out here. When be we a-goin'?” said Ægidius.</p><p>“HM. I MUST JUST PERFORM AN ATOMIC ANALYSIS OF THY COMPOSITION. PLEASE, WAIT A MOMENT” BOB once more shone violently. Ægidius was now not so amused that this entire lightshow was going to happen again and yet another portion of his fields was going to vanish. His worries were unfounded though. Bob's effulgence cast itself on Ægidius who now himself sparkled. It was unusually painless. Tickled a bit.</p><p>The effulgence vanished from Ægidius and returned to BOB. BOB's eyes went through several nuances where after an odd melody, “ze-ding-ding-brum-dang”. Quite like that of a modem of yore. BOB's mentality was quite obviously of the audible sort.</p><p>“MY MOST APPROPRIATE APOLOGIES FOR THE NOISE. WE, WOBBALONIANS FROM WOBBALON 7 POSSESS AN EXOCORPOREAL ANATOMY”</p><p>Again sounded the melody. Ægidius lit his pipe. It had to night even though morning could any moment break. The horse seemed to enjoy it. BOB noticed the horse.</p><p>“MY MOST APPROPRIATE APOLOGIES!”</p><p>Ægidius was puzzled for a moment over the sight of BOB silently walking almost floating towards the horse. Immediately BOB started small-talking with the horse. Strangely Ægidius could still understand BOB and now also the horse, whom apparently spoke very highly of Ægidius.</p><p>“I toil 'n' toil for 'im, but I'm not one to complain as long as I get my grass to chew'n day by day by day by day so I ain't one to complain, nope, I'm pretty satisfied with my lot in life. Yup, yeah. Just yesterday I was ploughing to and fro, to and fro, to and fro, to and fro..”</p><p>BOB seemed to find this unnaturally interesting, an insight into a terrestrial organism's life. Even the monotony was captivating. The patterns. Those he found captivating indeed.</p><p>“FASCINATING. QUITE SIMPLY FASCINATING! SUCH REDOUBTABLE MONOTONY. EVERYTHING IN THE OMNIVERSE IS IN RUDIMENTARY CHAOS. BUT HERE. LO, HERE IS MONOTONY. COSMIC ORDER. MONOTNY!”</p><p>“Cham'n't a-gettin' anythin' of ye just said. Can't we just be goin'” complained Ægidius impatiently.</p><p>“MOST CERTAINLY. PARDON ME. MY MOST APPROPRIATE APOLOGIES. POSTHASTE” said BOB and pulled a small silver orb from his rainbow-glowing tuxedo after which it started floating.</p><p>BOB let forth a eerie vibration from his interior and the ball vibrated accordingly. Now began both Ægidius and BOB shaking. The earth shook even though that was no earthquake. The skies were gleaming. Day and night occurred simultaneously.</p><p>“What in the blazin' bloody of hells be a-happenin'!?” shouted Ægidius.</p><p>“MOLECULAR TEMPORAL HARMONISATION. A TRANS-DIMENSIONAL SHORTCUT TO THE PLURALITY” said BOB.</p><p>“That sounds.. kinda nice.. methinks?” said Ægidius and lit his pipe, but the very moment his match struck fire the fire shone with a light of a multitude of colours almost like Christmas lights. And then it happened</p><p>“VERY WELL”</p><p>Everything howled around their ears and the ball absorbed both of them. Both were stretched to unfathomable lengths across cosmic latitudes. Around him he could see phantasmagorical visions. Nebulae. Worlds orbiting impossible constellations. Myriads of eyes peering at him, beholding him from the forbidden beginning of times. His mind was almost torn asunder. But it did not. Suddenly he felt squashed. His entire being, body and essence compressed to an infinitesimally minute point. Less than a particle and then instantaneously they were there. The Plurality.</p>

(ratecliff 155).   ye  as in the second person plural pronoun has long since passed into archaic or dialectal usage, but its usage as a singular pronoun is still present if rural – as such his habit of referring to the his interlocutors and other people as in the third person due to gollum himself constantly being within his own personal mental sphere has yet to show, he does however use the third person conjugation for all his verbs.  other words of note are  praps  as a colloquial shortening of “perhaps,” and “bitsy” which lends his speech a childish tone to it, a tinge of peculiar hospitality. this hospitality is very much in contrast to the deeply duplicitous and erratic trahald of the final version, who schemes to put a rather unceremonious end to anyone who as much as stares at him, yet alone wanting to take his  precious  away from him.  the gollum of the early hobbit, however, not only is friendlier, but is willing to part with the ring as a prize to bilbo for besting him in a game of riddles – completely in contrast to trahald’s enslavement-like addiction to the ring renders him abjectly at its will, hence his warped affection for his  precious –  a manner of supernatural fail-safe placed by sauron since its magic is too powerful to be used by anyone but by its one true master.  his childish mannerisms, eccentric speech patterns only increase as his character becomes more demented over the draughts and it was not until much, much later with the advent of  the lord of the rings , that tolkien went back and retroactively changed gollum’s exchange with bilbo to lessen his willingness to part with the ring and furthermore explicate the later significance of the ring in the later stories.  flash forward to the literary trahald that we know:  'yess, yes indeed,' said gollum sitting up. 'nice hobbits! we will come with them. find them safe paths in the dark, yes we will. and where are they going in these cold hard lands, we wonders, yes we wonders?

(Ratecliff 155).</blockquote><p><em>Ye</em> as in the second person plural pronoun has long since passed into archaic or dialectal usage, but its usage as a singular pronoun is still present if rural – as such his habit of referring to the his interlocutors and other people as in the third person due to Gollum himself constantly being within his own personal mental sphere has yet to show, he does however use the third person conjugation for all his verbs.</p><p>Other words of note are <em>praps </em>as a colloquial shortening of “perhaps,” and “bitsy” which lends his speech a childish tone to it, a tinge of peculiar hospitality. This hospitality is very much in contrast to the deeply duplicitous and erratic Trahald of the final version, who schemes to put a rather unceremonious end to anyone who as much as stares at him, yet alone wanting to take his <em>Precious </em>away from him.  The Gollum of the early Hobbit, however, not only is friendlier, but is willing to part with the Ring as a prize to Bilbo for besting him in a game of riddles – completely in contrast to Trahald’s enslavement-like addiction to the Ring renders him abjectly at its will, hence his warped affection for his <em>Precious – </em>a manner of supernatural fail-safe placed by Sauron since its magic is too powerful to be used by anyone but by its one true master.</p><p>His childish mannerisms, eccentric speech patterns only increase as his character becomes more demented over the draughts and it was not until much, much later with the advent of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, that Tolkien went back and retroactively changed Gollum’s exchange with Bilbo to lessen his willingness to part with the Ring and furthermore explicate the later significance of the Ring in the later stories.</p><p>Flash forward to the literary Trahald that we know:</p><blockquote>'Yess, yes indeed,' said Gollum sitting up. 'Nice hobbits! We will come with them. Find them safe paths in the dark, yes we will. And where are they going in these cold hard lands, we wonders, yes we wonders? ' He looked up at them, and a faint light of cunning and eagerness flickered for a second in his pale blinking eyes.  (Two Towers 219)</blockquote><p>In place is the habitual first person plural that speaks of his splintered mind, the third person endings abound and even though he is directly speaking to Frodo and Sam, he nevertheless refers to them in the third person since that is merely part of his distorted head, having spent several hundreds of years in isolation with eyes ever alert at dangers or people who would rob him of his Ring. His sibilants are also present with “yess”. His manner of speaking is very much a projection of what is going on his brain, a mode thinking aloud thus mixing his inner world with the exterior world in an inextricable fashion: Thereis only him and his <em>Precious, </em>thus the “we”, and whenever he is “I”, it is the original Stoor Hobbit Smeagol that surfaces unshackled from his mental manacles – as amiable as his prototypical self from the early versions of the Hobbit, if still maniacally unstable in terms of keeping a guard.</p><p><strong>Part II:</strong></p><p><strong>In Translation:</strong></p><p>From <em>Middle-earth: Shadow of War </em>by Monolith Productions and Warner Brothers Interactive Entertainment:</p><p>彼は思い出すよ　いとしいしと…思い出させてあがよう<br>(He remembers, yes, Precious… We makes him remember!)<br>He will remember, Precious... we will make him!<br>そうそう　そうだ！　取り戻すんだ…必ず<br>(Yes, yes… Of course! We must have it back! Must!)<br>Of course, of course, we must have it back! We must have it!<br>シッ　静かに　いとしいしと<br>(Grr! Shut up, Precious)<br>Grr! Quiet... quiet, Precious....</p><p>Bracketed is my own translation of the Japanese dialogue and beneath that is the actual official American English dialogue in the game.</p><p>Evident is his reference to “Precious” in the translation as <em>itoshiishito </em>(いとしいしと), a slurred form of the word <em>itoshiihito </em>(愛しい人, “beloved person”), thus presenting how the translators have rendered Gollum’s lisp and love of sibilants in addition to his universal application of the third person conjugations. This is eerily not present in the official dub, as seen above.</p><p>Not focusing on the English translation, we return later when Trahald is vouchsafing to the protagonist and his ghostly friend, do note that I have not included the official English version’s dialogue due to being unable to find it:</p><p>ご主人様も覚えてるはず！　そう　きっと覚えてる<br>わしら…　もっと宝を掘って…<br>そう　そう　そう　そうすれば連れて行ってくれる</p><p><em>Goshujinsama mo oboeteru hazu! Sou kittooboeteteru!</em><br><em>Washira… motto takara o hotte …</em><br><em>Sou sou sou sousureba tsureteittekureru</em></p><p>“We does it so Master remembers! So, surely Master remembers!<br>We digs for the treasure a bit more… <br>Yes, yes, yes… If Master follows us, please!”</p><p>Trahald uses <em>washira </em>represented as わしら and ワシら in mixed katakana and hiragana scripts, presumably hinting at the Gollum and Smeagol personalities being at work, the pronoun in question is the plural form of <em>washi</em>, a pronoun primarily associated with old folks, ancient beings and historically the Hiroshima dialect. Within the bounds of Fantasy and RPGs, the pronoun is used by wizards, dragons and supernatural spirits thus Trahald due to being several hundreds of years old fits the role of the Fantasy language. In his youth he used <em>ore </em>(俺), the regular informal pronoun used by males, as is evidenced by the Japanese dub of the films – in the times dating hundreds of years back when he first found the ring near the river of the Stoor’s village, and subsequently leading to his slaying his brother Deagol and thus Trahald becoming the ghoulish troglodyte due to the magical ring. Deagol himself uses <em>boku </em>(僕), a benign male informal pronoun that contrasts it against the rougher <em>ore </em>of Smeagol himself.</p><p>He uses the regular existential verb <em>iru</em> (いる, “to be”) rather than the older <em>oru </em>(おる) as would be expected for someone who uses <em>washi</em> and is an ancient being.</p><p>The dialogue of the games are in direct relation to the official Japanese dubs in terms of speech patterns and voice actors.</p><p>In regards to the books, I have unfortunately not been able to find a copy, but it seems that his speech patterns are essentially the same there as they are in the games and films.</p>

Despite his stiff manner of speaking, Uatu is nevertheless a polite chap.</p><p>After much talking, rather Uatu speaking in stately paragraphs of exposition and Stephen merely asking one or two questions, Uatu lapses into the grand tradition of scientific jargon or babble:</p><blockquote>My hypothesis is that in a little more than four hundred years from now.

Notice also “current cycles of destruction” referring to a recurring system of presumed rebirth and also the ever favourite “cycle” for evaluating units of time in a science fiction setting.</p><p>At the very end of the comic series, we meet Uatu’s superior, who congratulates Uatu upon his mission and reassures him that:</p><blockquote><br><em><strong>We will never know, Ikor’s child, will we?</strong></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><strong>All is now well. The universes continue as much as we are shamed by you, we are proud of you.</strong></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><strong>And, so that you do not forget your shame, and so that we do not forget your triumph, the High Tribunal have a gift for you. We have grafted it from the fringes of alternity.</strong></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><strong>It is small. Keep it safely.</strong></em></blockquote><p>It runs in the family, the lack of contractions, “fringes of alternity” and so on conform with the Watcher’s stately cosmic socielect. Further points for archaic diction goes to his referring to Uatu as “Ikor’s child,” a much loved tradition of authors such as Tolkien.</p><p>In addition he uses “shall” and “will” as adheres to the notions of obligation and eventuality to the former and volition to the latter, whereas in American English, the language of the Marvel comics, “shall” in particular has become archaic and formal – such is not the case in British English, however.</p><p>Translating the diction of this cosmic watchman should have a focus on the archaic elements, using a language that at the same time also eschews any colloquial traits and adheres towards mentioning the nature of his vocation and his hallowing his vow of passivity and neutrality in all of his observations.</p><p>To this point we will look at the Japanese translation of the 2006 multiplatform RPG “Marvel: Ultimate Alliance,” where our bulb-headed beholder has the task of updating the player’s team of any eventual developments and in general being a walking, living and breathing repository for answers and prodding the player in the right direction – ever so cautiously throwing his onus of non-intervention to the wind.</p><p>During the very beginning of the game we are greeted by Uatu:</p><blockquote>I am Uatu, the Watcher. I prevented your deaths, for you are needed to save this universe. Listen closely, mortals. Doctor Doom's unrestrained use of Odin's power will soon tear the fabric of reality beyond repair. I have broken my sacred vow to only observe so that I may give you this one chance to save your world.</blockquote><p>Thus we meet “mortals” in reference to the superheroes, and him having “broken my sacred vow only to observe” that he serve as the players’ guide, in plural as it is also a multi-player game.</p><p>我が名はウアトゥ<br>ウォッチャー<br>そなたたちの命を救った<br>この宇宙を救うには、そなたたちの力が必要だ<br>しかと聞くのだ、地球の民よ<br>Dr.ドゥームはオーディンの力をもてあそんでいる<br>このままでは現実に修復不可能なほころびが生じてしまう<br>観察の大任に捧げたこの身だが、今こそ聖なる誓いを破ろう<br>そなたたちに、ただ一度のチャンスを与える<br>この宇宙を救うのために</p><p><em>Waga na wa Uatu<br>Wocchâ<br>Sonata-tachi no inochi o sukutta<br>Kono uchuu o sukutta ni wa, sonata-tachi no chikara ga hitsuyou da.<br>Shikato kikunoda, chikyuu no tami yo.<br>Dokutâ Dûmu wa Ôdin no chikara o mote asonde iru.<br>Kono mama de wa genjitsu ni shuufuku fukanousei na horobi ga unjite shimau.<br>Kansatsu no tainin ni sazugeta kono mi daga, ima koso seinaru chikai o yaburou sonata-tachi ni, tada ichido no chansu o ataeru<br>Kono uchuu o sukuu no tame ni</em></p><p>"My name is Uatu<br>The Watcher<br>I have saved your lives.<br>Your powers are vital if the universe is to be saved.<br>Therefore listen well, ye People of Earth.<br>Doctor Doom has been playing with Odin’s powers,<br>At this rate we shall face the emergence of the possibility of the complete annihilation of reality.<br>I have therefore broken my hallowed vowing to the great obligation of observation.<br>Ye have but only this one chance that I give unto you all, for the sake of saving the universe!"</p><p><em>Waga na </em>(我が名) - “My name is”, this is a stock-phrase in most Japanese media for when an ancient character introduces themselves, and also rather solemn since it uses the archaic genitive case of the first person pronoun <em>ware </em>(我), itself of Old Japanese stock.</p><p>He refers to the cast as <em>sonata-tachi </em>(そなたたち) the plural of <em>sonata </em>(そなた) an archaic pronoun akin to “thou”, but somewhat more amiable, hence my choice of rendering it as “ye/you (all)”. There no colloquial contractions in sight, such as でる for でいる, but he preserves the latter, i.e. “to be” or “to be doing something.”</p><p>The noun <em>tainin </em>(大任), referring to a great responsibility or obligation is fairly formal thus befitting his mentioning his vocation and the significance of his breaking his holy vow of only to observe in order to help the player and to that extent the superhero team.</p><p>Later on the team meets Uatu at the lunar base:</p><p>地球上の事件には干渉せぬと誓った私だが、この危機を見過ごすことはできぬ。ドウームがオーディンの力を乱用したため宇宙の構造が崩壊しつつあるのだ。これを止められるのは諸君のみだ</p><p><em>Chikyū jō no jiken ni wa kanshō senu to chikatta watashidaga , kono kiki o misugosu koto wa dekinu . doūmu ga ōdin no chikara o ranyō shita tame uchū no kōzō ga hōkai shitsutsu aru noda . kore o tomerareru no wa shokun nomida.</em></p><p>“I vowed not to interfere with the affairs on Earth, but this is simply a crisis that I cannot ignore. Doom’s unbridled usage of Odin’s power is causing the universe to collapse into ruin. Only you, ladies and gentlemen, can stop this.”</p><p>Do note that the translation above is my own since I could not find the proper official English original version of the lines.</p><p>Uatu uses <em>watashi</em> (私), a gender neutral first person pronoun that in fiction has a nuance of nobility and aloofness – though outside of this usage it is primarily a female pronoun. His usage of this suggests once more an adherence to sheer logic and its status as the general polite pronoun also implies his generous disposition towards the superheroes, coupled with <em>sonata-tachi </em>(そなたたち), which itself was also polite and he speaks in a fairly reverent old fashioned way, though not too deferential either.</p><p>He uses the archaic particle of negation <em>nu</em> (ぬ), i.e. <em>senu </em>(せぬ, “will not”) and <em>dekinu</em> (できぬ, “cannot”), rather than ~<em>nai </em>thus <em>shinai </em>(しない) and <em>dekinai </em>(できない) – further enhancing his status as a cosmic being.</p>

He is an elderly gentleman and as such uses <em>washi</em>, his katakana version gives off a carefree and eccentric vibe since the pronoun is usually rendered in hiragana, which fits his personality.</p><p>In hiragana - わし</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/10/yoda-washi-2.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="528" height="551"></figure><p>わしにフォースがついておる<br><em>Washi ni fôsu ga tsuite oru</em><br>"I am wreathed in the Force."</p><p>The elderly Jedi-mater Yoda, makes a guest appearance in the Japanese fighting game <em>Soul Caibur IV</em>, hence the original Japanese version features dialogue in the language. As seen above the Grandmaster uses わし (washi) in the hiragana form, befitting his venerable status. His language is otherwise ordinary Hiroshima dialect, unlike the Elizabethan inverted speech of the original.</p><p><strong>Coming up next time - </strong>We go through additional pronouns and see how they differ in terms of how they are written.</p>

(own translation)  we therefore see that old english  sceal  performs the task of an ordinary verb rather than a mere modal auxiliary verb. hence in danish the word  skulle  (&quot;should&quot;) is etymologically related to  skyld  (&quot;guilt&quot;) - since one feels as if it is a personal matter that you owe a person something. as mentioned, in a similar vein  ought  derives as the older past tense of  owe  thus the deontic, grammatical term for modal verbs and constructions implying duty or obligation, aspect derives from the same sense of owing someone something or having to return a favour. the proto indo-european etymon of  shall  is * skel(o)  meaning &quot;guilt, blame.&quot;  likewise, &quot;will&quot;, both the verb and the noun denoting actions appertaining to &quot;volition&quot; or &quot;wish&quot; stem ultimately from the proto indo-european * welh  meaning &quot;to choose, to want&quot;, there is therefore a strict contrast even in ancient times between one term, shall, referring to owing someone the favour or feeling indebted thus prompting one to perform an action to repay it and vice versa, will, one that is not bound by obligation, but by volition which therefore also infers choice and selection.   one might say that &quot;will&quot; therefore as a modal verb at its most basic level is less binding than that of &quot;shall.&quot; speaking of not just the two words in the context of their english descendants, but also the rest of the germanic languages in terms of where their usage is continued to be used as indicators of duty and volition - in addition to auxiliary markers of the future tense.  i  wil  syster that ye wete he is a ful noble knyȝt.  &quot;i  will  sister that ye know that he is a fully noble knight&quot;  le morte d'arthur, vii.  here &quot;will&quot; expresses its most basic aspect of willing, wishing or wanting to do something, we might in english instead rephrase it as &quot;i want you to know, sister, that he is a wholly noble knight&quot;, where &quot;want&quot; has replaced the middle english modal verb in its sense wishing or wanting something of someone.   we seen still this aspect in danish, where the quote can be translated as &quot;jeg vil gerne have at du skal vide at han er en komplet ædel ridder.&quot; what is worth noting is that the adverb &quot;gerne&quot; (to want to, to be desirous of doing) is added to strengthen the aspect of the speaker's desire to inform the interlocutor, his sister, &quot;at du skal/bør vide&quot; is added as a subordinate to strengthen the informational aspect of the sentence, but it is nevertheless proof that this ancient usage has not fully become obsolete in germanic languages. it is possible to render it as &quot;jeg vil (at) du ved (at) han er en helt (igennem) ædel ridder&quot;, but this can sound archaic hence the adverbial verbs needed to render it in a more modern register.

The Proto Indo-European etymon of <em>shall</em> is *<em>skel(o)</em> meaning "guilt, blame."</p><p>Likewise, "will", both the verb and the noun denoting actions appertaining to "volition" or "wish" stem ultimately from the Proto Indo-European *<em>welh</em> meaning "to choose, to want", there is therefore a strict contrast even in ancient times between one term, shall, referring to owing someone the favour or feeling indebted thus prompting one to perform an action to repay it and vice versa, will, one that is not bound by obligation, but by volition which therefore also infers choice and selection. </p><p>One might say that "will" therefore as a modal verb at its most basic level is less binding than that of "shall." Speaking of not just the two words in the context of their English descendants, but also the rest of the Germanic languages in terms of where their usage is continued to be used as indicators of duty and volition - in addition to auxiliary markers of the future tense.</p><blockquote>I <strong>wil</strong> syster that ye wete he is a ful noble knyȝt.</blockquote><p>"I <strong>will</strong> sister that ye know that he is a fully noble knight"<br><br>Le Morte D'Arthur, VII.</p><p>Here "will" expresses its most basic aspect of willing, wishing or wanting to do something, we might in English instead rephrase it as "I want you to know, sister, that he is a wholly noble knight", where "want" has replaced the Middle English modal verb in its sense wishing or wanting something of someone. </p><p>We seen still this aspect in Danish, where the quote can be translated as "Jeg vil gerne have at du skal vide at han er en komplet ædel ridder." What is worth noting is that the adverb "gerne" (to want to, to be desirous of doing) is added to strengthen the aspect of the speaker's desire to inform the interlocutor, his sister, "at du skal/bør vide" is added as a subordinate to strengthen the informational aspect of the sentence, but it is nevertheless proof that this ancient usage has not fully become obsolete in Germanic languages. It is possible to render it as "Jeg vil (at) du ved (at) han er en helt (igennem) ædel ridder", but this can sound archaic hence the adverbial verbs needed to render it in a more modern register.</p>

 the cybernetic hero, joe shimamura of  cyborg 009  by shoutarou ishinomori, is a famous user of  boku (ぼく), here in hiragana due to the typographical preferences of the time. he does use ore (おれ) early on, but switches to the other pronoun, presumably to reflect his more gentle nature.   girls who use masculine pronouns, and those who nearly do so:   tomboys are no stranger in japanese media and culture. in manga and anime, which is the specific media type that we shall be covering here we will be looking into a few examples:     akira from hunter cats: うるせ！！　オレたちに「わらわれやすい服装してこい」なんて注意するほうがちがいだぜ (shaddap! it’s different to tell us to “come and wear ridiculous clothes”, don’t ya think?)  notice   オレたち  (ore-tachi) which is the masculine plural pronoun used, in singular and kanji form  俺 (ore). furthermore there is うるせ (uruse, “annoying/shut up”) itself a more rough version of うるさい (urusai, “bothersome/annoying”), and the masculine emphatic partile ぜ (ze). this is in contrast to her fellow hunter cats who use standard female language such as わたし (watashi) for the first person singular pronoun. such archetypes are colloquially known as オレ子 (ore-ko, “ ore -girl”). she gets confused for being a male later on.     あんたには悪いけど あたしらのために死んでもらうよッ！！ (i feel sorry for ya, but you’ll have to die for our sake!)  next is shîna from the tales of symphonia series of ">

Below are some typical problems and also the most pertinent in regards to first person pronouns:</p><p><strong>Part I: A Difference in masculinity and femininity:</strong></p><p><em><strong>Boku</strong></em><strong>-guys and <em>ore</em>-guys – 70s versus 90s:</strong></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/10/image.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="615" height="437" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/10/image.png 615w"></figure><p>一子相伝の暗殺拳北斗神拳の前にはボウガンの矢など止まった棒にすぎん<br>おれは闘いのプロだ　きさまには殺せん！<br><br>“It is not all excessive in front of the heir of the assassin’s fist, <em>Hokuto Shinken</em>, to stop a bow-gun’s dart with a mere pole. I am professional at fighting. You cannot kill me.”<br><br>The most famous user of  <em>ore </em>is Kenshiro from Tetsuo Hara and Buronson’s 1984 martial arts epic “<em>Fist of the North Star” (</em>北斗の拳). Notice how he use おれ in hiragana rather than katakana, this was very much common practice during this early period, where during the later decades オレ won usage, but おれ still lingers.</p><p>It ought to be noticed that Kenshiro otherwise, like most male characters in the series, uses archaic constructions and at times uses the emphatic particle わ (wa), ordinarily an element of female sociolects, but an archaic masculine emphatic particle, and still current in the dialects of Tokyo for male speakers. As an 80s hero, he stands in contrast to the <em>boku</em>-heroes of past series.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/10/joe-shimamura-boku.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="269" height="296"></figure><p>な、なぜ　ぼく……<br>こんなことができるんだ！<br>W-Why am I… able to do such things!?<br><br>The cybernetic hero, Joe Shimamura of <em>Cyborg 009</em> by Shoutarou Ishinomori, is a famous user of <em>boku</em>(ぼく), here in hiragana due to the typographical preferences of the time. He does use ore (おれ) early on, but switches to the other pronoun, presumably to reflect his more gentle nature.</p><p><strong>Girls who use masculine pronouns, and those who nearly do so:</strong></p><p>Tomboys are no stranger in Japanese media and culture. In manga and anime, which is the specific media type that we shall be covering here we will be looking into a few examples:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/10/oretachi.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="507" height="468"></figure><p>Akira from Hunter Cats:<br>うるせ！！　オレたちに「わらわれやすい服装してこい」なんて注意するほうがちがいだぜ<br>(Shaddap! It’s different to tell us to “come and wear ridiculous clothes”, don’t ya think?)<br><br>Notice <u><strong>オレたち</strong></u>(ore-tachi) which is the masculine plural pronoun used, in singular and kanji form</p><p>俺 (ore). Furthermore there is うるせ (uruse, “annoying/shut up”) itself a more rough version of うるさい (urusai, “bothersome/annoying”), and the masculine emphatic partile ぜ (ze). This is in contrast to her fellow Hunter Cats who use standard female language such as わたし (watashi) for the first person singular pronoun. Such archetypes are colloquially known as オレ子 (ore-ko, “<em>ore</em>-girl”).<br>She gets confused for being a male later on.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/10/image-1.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="384" height="716"></figure><p>あんたには悪いけど<br>あたしらのために死んでもらうよッ！！<br>(I feel sorry for ya, but you’ll have to die for our sake!)<br><br>Next is Shîna from the Tales of Symphonia series of games who uses the rough female plural あたしら (atashi-ra). This accords with her usage of the 2<sup>nd</sup>person singular あんた (anta), an abbreviated and slangier version あなた (anata). The usage of the rough plural suffix 等 (ra) versus that of 達 (tachi) signifies a slightly more masculine approach towards her presentation. She does however switch over to much more courteous forms when addressing her superior.</p><p>Hence as we can see with the above, even though one uses a standard male pronoun and the other a slangier version of わたし (watashi), they both use masculine speech patterns.</p><p>Yellow de Tokiwagrove from Pocket Monster Special:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/10/image-2.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="311" height="356"></figure><p>いいなあー、私もそんなお友だちがほしいあ。<br><em>That sounds great. I would like such friends, too.</em></p><p>Initially she uses the standard 私 (watashi) during her début in the third volume of the manga. </p><p>Later on, concealing herself as a boy per instructions from the Gym Leader, Katsura, she uses ボク (boku), and continues to do so even after her true identity has been revealed to the main cast.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/10/image-3.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="909" height="458" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image-3.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/10/image-3.png 909w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>このボクが助ける！<br>I will help him!</p><p>Such as seen in the image above.</p>

  washi   no erisuguri no heishitachi wa oi no eomeru ni tsuite itta   however we have no might! my very best soldiers have left along with my nephew, eomer.  to which gandalf replies:  そう  じゃの  　  あんた  への　しんらいは うすれて  おった  　  じゃ  が　すべてが なくなったわけではない　これから とりもどせば  よい  の  じゃ  　おうざは   まもられた  の  じゃから  ！   sou   jano     anta   e no shinrai wa usurete otta   jaga   subete ga naku natta wake de wa nai korekara torimodoseneba  yoi   no   ja   ouza wa   mamorareta   no   jakara  !   that is indeed true, their reliance upon you has grown weak, that means not that all is lost, afterwards, you should do well to recover, as the throne as been protected!  few things of note here, namely theoden himself is also a  washi  user and refers to himself and his royal household with the formal  warera.  he also uses the formal possessive  waga  to refer to his royal lineage. gandalf overall uses the amiable  anta  towards theoden, whereas  anata , whence the informal second person pronoun stems, would be more fitting when referring to a king or perhaps even  anatasama.   gandalf also uses the emphatic particle  no  which corresponds to the standard japanese  ne  that adds an element of friendly assurance or questioning. he uses the respectful passive tense with  mamorareta  (you have protected the throne) in reference to theoden having warded off the attackers. gandalf p">
